					<description><![CDATA[Why do I like Jarvis Cocker so much? I&#039;m supposed to be seething with rage as he stepped onstage with fashion model/child actor, Julian Casablancas, but I ended up liking Julian. I only like a few Pulp songs and I think his solo albums are crap, well, just the second one.  If people have irrational hatred towards bands, I have unexplainable love for Jarvis. I&#039;m not even gay. I just really, really like him. I really do. Did I mention that I like him?]]></description>
