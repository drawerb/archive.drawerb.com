					<description><![CDATA[Personally i found this album &quot;Big Group Hug&quot; an absolute sublime listen, there&#039;s instrumentals and instrumentals,  and &quot;Blood Bath&quot; (track 2),...is the most gorgeous piece of music to pass these ears  in quite some time ...plenty of space giving great dynamics, and production wise, well in short ... floorless!
The rest of the album is in keeping with the soft texture approach emitted by track 2 ...other songs include a subtle amount of vox, and tend to blend in comfortably, not breaking away from the overall mood of Saso&#039;s musical direction!
&#062;
A definite &#039;Must Own&#039; album ...still loving it after all these years!]]></description>
