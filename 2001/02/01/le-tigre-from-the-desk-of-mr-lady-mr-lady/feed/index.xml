					<description><![CDATA[Am I the only one who can tell the difference between Hanna&#039;s voice and Fateman&#039;s voice? 
This is the same old argument against Hanna&#039;s music, when it&#039;s always been a collaborative effort! The music has no real melody; the politics outweigh the art, or lack of art reflecting the symplicity of the cathartic creation. You either get it, or you don&#039;t. I like the fact that the songs and topics are reactionary. It&#039;s not a bunch of crappy love songs about what a crappy person the singer is and how much they love &quot;God&quot; and how great &quot;God&quot; is.  It&#039;s a bunch of crappy new wave punk rock songs I can really jam out to.]]></description>
