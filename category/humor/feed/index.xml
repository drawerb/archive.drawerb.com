<p>Unless you have God-given perfect pitch, singing live is no easy feat. So many variables with which to contend. If you can&#8217;t hear yourself, you&#8217;re totally effed. So, I feel slightly bad about posting this, but at the same time I love these isolated tracks when they show up on YouTube because, you know, trainwrecks and all that &#8230; can&#8217;t avert your eyes or ears in this case. Speaking of train wrecks, it&#8217;s Courtney Love. And, man, there&#8217;s not enough pitch shifting software in the world to fix this catastrophe. And then there&#8217;s the isolated guitar playing. Good God. This was posted out of spite by a sound man who was commissioned to record this particular show, but no one wanted to pay the invoice. So, he shared his recording. [via <a href="http://www.buddyhead.com/2014/11/21/courtney-loves-isolated-live-vocal-guitar-tracks/">Buddyhead</a>]		</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<a href="http://media.drawerb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/media/2014/10/photo026.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Last week, Mark Kozelek seemingly joked that he&#8217;d written a song called <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/56916-mark-kozelek-challenges-the-war-on-drugs-to-let-him-join-them-onstage/">&#8220;War on Drugs: Suck My Cock.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I challenge War On Drugs to let me join them onstage and play a hilarious song I&#8217;ve written called &#8216;War On Drugs: Suck My Cock/Sun Kil Moon: Go Fuck Yourself&#8217; at the Fillmore, October 6,&#8221; Kozelek wrote in on his website (in a post that seems to have since been deleted), &#8220;provided they let me handle the beer commercial lead guitar.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t joking. Kozelek <a href="http://sunkilmoon.com/mkwod/index.html">released the song</a> to his Sun Kil Moon website at midnight EST, presumably right before The War on Drugs took the stage at its sold-out show at The Fillmore in San Francisco. In addition to repeatedly inviting the Philadelphia band to &#8220;suck my cock,&#8221; he talks about the Sun Kil Moon Hopscotch performance where he called the crowd <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/56628-mark-kozeleks-label-selling-all-you-fuckin-hillbillies-shut-the-fuck-up-t-shirt/">&#8220;fuckin&#8217; hillbillies.&#8221;</a> (He&#8217;s still <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/56628-mark-kozeleks-label-selling-all-you-fuckin-hillbillies-shut-the-fuck-up-t-shirt/">selling T-shirts</a> emblazoned with the slogan.)</p>
<p>The War on Drugs dudes, Kozelek concedes, are &#8220;pretty nice,&#8221; but &#8220;definitely the whitest fuckin&#8217; band I&#8217;ve ever heard.&#8221; &#8220;Sounded like basic John Fogerty rock,&#8221; he sings, and, later: &#8220;The War on Drugs loves John Mellencamp.&#8221; Also: &#8220;Bridge-and-tunnel people<i> love</i> them some War on Drugs.&#8221; Burn, yo.</p>
<p>The song is actually, as Kozelek claimed it would be, kind of hilarious — whether it&#8217;s intentional or because it paints Kozelek as an increasingly crochety, curmudgeonly dude. For instance, he follows up following up a line about The War on Drugs&#8217; &#8220;beer commercial lead guitar&#8221; by yelping &#8220;Wait, there&#8217;s more!&#8221; and deploying a harmonized dual-guitar line. After needling the band with &#8220;To make three albums, took &#8217;em nine fuckin&#8217; years!,&#8221; a canned audience applauds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all tongue-in-cheek: He lashes out at <a href="http://www.indyweek.com/music/archives/2014/09/06/hopscotch-night-two-a-picnic"><em>Indyweek</em> writer Allison Hussey</a> with the particularly vituperative couplet &#8220;Someone got offended and wrote a piece of crap / Some spoiled bitch rich kid blogger brat.&#8221; Not cool, Kozzy.</p>
<p>The War on Drugs, meanwhile, have yet to respond with a song called &#8220;Sun Kil Moon: Go Fuck Yourself.&#8221; I&#8217;d pay to hear that one.</p>
<p><a href="http://sunkilmoon.com/mkwod/index.html">Stream the song</a> from Sun Kil Moon&#8217;s website, or <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/56989-here-it-is-mark-kozeleks-song-called-war-on-drugs-suck-my-cock/">download</a> it from Pitchfork.		</p>

<p>To paraphrase Walt Whitman: Does Prince contradict himself? Very well, then. He is large, and he contains multitudes.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/prince-files-lawsuit-over-links-to-music-file-sharing-sites/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0"><em>The New York Times</em> reported</a> that two weeks ago Prince Rogers Nelson filed a lawsuit — well, his lawyers did on his behalf, anyway — against 22 bootleggers who allegedly posted unauthorized recordings of his concerts to peer-to-peer sharing sites and their Facebook pages. The timestamp on the most recent update to the <em>Times</em> story reads 4:11 p.m. EST. (Oh, and</p>
<p>But not more than three hours later, The Purple One changed his mind, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/01/28/prince-drops-22-million-lawuit-bootleggers-music/">TMZ reported</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, he also dropped a teaser of &#8220;PRETZELBODYLOGIC,&#8221; a song from his 3rd Eye Girl collaboration with Donna Grantis, Hannah Ford and Ida Neilsen. You can hear the 30-second clip above.</p>
<p>The lesson, as always: Prince moves in mysterious ways.		</p>

<p>Locks of hair, maybe. At least you could clone Elvis with those. But his Bible? Some schmo <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/elvis-bible-sells-for-94-000-at-auction-20120909">paid $94,000</a> for Elvis&#8217; favorite book. This Bible was given to the King back in 1957 and contains personal annotations and notes. My mind races thinking about what might have moved him to put his pen to the margins of his beloved Bible. Recipes for fried peanut butter and honey? Where to store the glitter belts? The lyrics to &#8220;Hound Dog?&#8221; Guesses as to how many animals were on the Ark? If the winner of said auction has as much funny bone as he does money, he will reproduce these somewhere.		</p>
