<p>Harkening back to the mid-90s, Sony/Legacy is <a href="https://www.legacyrecordings.com/2019/08/01/the-prince-estate-in-partnership-with-legacy-recordings-announces-next-wave-of-titles-in-definitive-prince-reissue-project-coming-friday-september-13/">reissuing</a> the first batch of albums released just after Prince had changed his name to the Love Symbol (O(+&gt;) for the first time ever on vinyl. These albums have been out of print for decades and come with exorbitant prices on the collector&#8217;s market.</p>



<p><em>The Versace Experience (Prelude 2 Gold)</em> was originally handed out as a cassette mix-tape for Paris Fashion Week back in 1995 and served as a preview of <em>The Gold Experience</em>. It was reissued on cassette earlier this year as a <a href="https://recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/10571">Record Store Day exclusive</a>.  Hopefully, the sound issues on that cassette reissue have been addressed for this vinyl edition.</p>



<span id="more-7841"></span>



<p>Next up is <em>Chaos and Disorder</em>, which was Prince&#8217;s middle finger to Warner Bros.- a contractually obligated compilation of &#8220;vault&#8221; tracks that were &#8220;originally intended for private use only&#8221; and that Prince famously refused to promote (although he did play &#8220;Dinner with Delores&#8221; on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2457856387611348">Today Show</a> in summer 1996). Long considered a throwaway album, <em>Chaos and Disorder</em> is criminally underrated. It&#8217;s Prince&#8217;s angriest, most rocking, guitar-centric album of the 90s.</p>



<p>And rounding out the reissues is <em>Emancipation</em>, Prince&#8217;s official debut as a &#8220;free man&#8221; from the confines record contracts and, specifically, Warner Bros. Records. It&#8217;s a triple album spread across six pieces of vinyl that showcases every aspect of Prince&#8217;s songwriting prowess. Despite its obvious need for an editor and some production variance, <em>Emancipation </em>stands as one of Prince&#8217;s defining moments. </p>



<p>You can sample Pussy Control (Club Mix) from <em>The Versace Experience (Prelude 2 Gold)</em> below now, and pre-order the records <a href="https://store.prince.com/dept/legacy-reissues?cp=103229_104317">here</a>.</p>

<p>Last summer Robert Smith <a href="http://www.slicingupeyeballs.com/2018/06/24/cure-meltdown-setlist-audio-stream/">curated the Meltdown festival</a> in the UK with handpicked acts ranging from My Bloody Valentine to Nine In Nails to The Church. The Cure, of course, headlined but were billed as CURÆTION-25 so as not to violate a contract for its massive headlining slot a few weeks later in London&#8217;s Hyde Park. Both shows are being combined for a <a href="https://www.post-punk.com/the-cure-to-release-meltdown-and-hyde-park-40th-anniversary-dvd-blu-ray-live-album-box-set/?fbclid=IwAR3a0C5yvWAfCvcd4LotYY13wzQaaSyIwDaSBS9JVHcDXoHF653-fPdopIQ">DVD/Blu-Ray release</a> this October to celebrate the band&#8217;s 40th anniversary. The setlists are expectedly massive, showcasing every idiosyncratic incarnation of the band. </p>



<p>Smith recently <a href="https://www.post-punk.com/the-cures-new-album-may-take-a-bit-longer-to-be-finished-says-robert-smith-in-interview-with-japanese-radio-dj-chigusa/amp/">revealed an update</a> for the band&#8217;s progress on its first new album in 11 years in an interview at the Fuji Rock Festival, claiming that the record will be delayed until next year. He had originally claimed it would be out close to Halloween this year. Even casual Cure fans know not to trust anything the man says with regard to release timelines. </p>

<p><a href="http://thereplacementsofficial.com/pages/home">The Replacements</a> have announced a new box set of alternate versions of the songs that comprised its penultimate album, <em>Don&#8217;t Tell A Soul</em>. Across four discs, an LP, and a cassette, the new set, entitled <em>Dead Man&#8217;s Pop</em>, presents <em>Don&#8217;t Tell A Soul</em> as it was originally intended, according to the press release over at <a href="https://store.rhino.com/dead-man-s-pop-4cd-1lp-deluxe-cassette.html">Rhino</a>. </p>



<p>Some of the alternate takes include the notoriously debauched and drunken sessions with producer Tony Berg at Bearsville Studios from 1988, as well as the infamous sessions later that same year mutual fan with Tom Waits!?! </p>



<p>The whole package is capped off with a book by Bob Mehr, who wrote the band&#8217;s biography,  <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qk-3wacOC8V1d0WX6cNfMgwAAAFsG0O_sQEAAAFKAbjM_F8/https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Boys-True-Story-Replacements/dp/0306825368?creativeASIN=0306825368&amp;linkCode=w50&amp;tag=pitchfo2020-20&amp;imprToken=IlsCtbvkkfmPz4Uv4vww8A&amp;slotNum=0" target="_blank">Trouble Boys: The True Story of the Replacements</a></em>. Dead Man&#8217;s Pop is out September 27, 2019 via <a href="https://store.rhino.com/dead-man-s-pop-4cd-1lp-deluxe-cassette.html">Rhino</a>.</p>

<p>Despite <a href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/blur-refuse-parklife-reunion-brexit-row/">refusing to perform</a> its breakout album for the 25th anniversary of Parklife, Blur is acknowledging the occasion by re-releasing a <a href="https://shop.blur.co.uk/?utm_campaign=blur21&amp;utm_medium=web_link&amp;utm_source=blur_site">vintage line of merchandise</a>, as well as a 10&#8243; record of a previously unreleased live <a href="https://store.warnermusic.com/live-at-the-bbc.html">BBC session</a>.  No word yet on a special edition of the album itself. <br><br>The <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/damon-albarn-reveals-blur-turned-down-parklife-25th-anniversary-shows-2475756">show refusal</a> dates back to April of this year, where lead singer Damon Albarn voiced his concern over the Brexit situation, saying: &#8220;Say we got to the point of having a second referendum, then I would be happy to play that record as a celebration and as a way of reminding ourselves of a time when we had an idea of Britishness that wasn’t political.&#8221; <br><br>Maybe the band will soften on the idea as these releases roll out. That record deserves to be celebrated.</p>

<p>Janet Weiss <a href="https://twitter.com/jazzzhand/status/1145691391034445824?s=20">announced today</a> that she is leaving Sleater-Kinney because the band is heading in a &#8220;new direction.&#8221; This will no doubt be devastating news for many, as Sleater-Kinney won&#8217;t be the same without her. Weiss&#8217;s drumming style helped define the band&#8217;s raucous sound, as it evolved from wailing indie-punk to an explosive power trio.<br><br>Weiss&#8217; statement reads diplomatically enough, but one can&#8217;t help but wonder what precipitated such a decision. There is speculation that the band&#8217;s radical <a href="https://youtu.be/E5uAH0vNn2s">new sound</a> with producer St. Vincent at the helm has colored her attitude towards the music- her bored expression in recent publicity photos, notwithstanding.  </p>

<p>A definitive version of Silkworm&#8217;s 1994 classic <em>In The West</em> is forthcoming from Comedy Minus One records. It has been remixed from the original two-inch tape by Steve Albini, who also served as the engineer on the initial recording sessions. The physical release will be on double vinyl with re-imagined artwork and limited to 1500 copies. A bonus CD completes the package featuring 7&#8243; b-sides and a live version of &#8220;Halloween.&#8221; This streaming version of album highlight &#8220;Dremate&#8221; is limited to the download accompaniment to the <a href="https://www.comedyminusone.com/2019/03/11/details-on-preorders-for-the-silkworm-2x12-cd-in-the-west-reissue/">bundle</a>. <br><br>Despite being released in the midst of college radio&#8217;s halcyon days, this record has never before been released on vinyl. Mindblowingly, Silkworm also released <em>Libterine </em>later that same year.       </p>

<p>In other bizarre, unexpected <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/57497-babes-in-toyland-announce-reunion-show/">reunion news</a>, Minneapolis&#8217; <a href="https://myspace.com/babesintoylandmusic">Babes in Toyland</a> have announced its first shows in 18 years. I first saw BIT when I was in high school at a tiny club in Nashville, and it scared the ever-living shit out of me. Ket Bjelland&#8217;s manic stage presence is not for the faint of heart. And it turns out <a href="http://blog.thecurrent.org/2013/03/kat-bjelland-on-babes-and-toyland-and-her-long-and-winding-musical-path/">her demons were/are real</a>, which makes it all even crazier. A trio of Google employees are <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-babes-in-toylands-unlikely-reunion-20141118">footing the bill</a> for the reunion, which is as surprising as it is cool. The fact that this band ever made it to a major label is quite a coup and just reiterates the power of Nirvana&#8217;s impact on the music business in the early 1990&#8217;s. Hit singles were not in the cards for this band, but by God they rocked.   		</p>
