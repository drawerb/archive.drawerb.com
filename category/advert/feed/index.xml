<p>Analog synth-God Gary Numan plays his lone hit single, &#8220;Cars&#8221;, on two dozen cars powered by one DieHard car battery. It&#8217;s a clever spectacle. Points to DieHard for having the balls and open-mindedness to enlist an underground luminary like Numan, who will very likely go unrecognized by the masses, save for music nerds and elder Goths that err on the side of new wave. As surreal as it is to see Gary Numan in a commercial for car batteries, I must admit I found this round of soul-selling more than worthy of watching. The version of &#8220;Cars&#8221; that plays the commercial out is rumored to be an updated take featuring fellow black-clad-musician-favoring-darkness, Trent Reznor.   		</p>

I&#8217;m a big fan of gadgets, especially those that relate to music. So, when you combine a cool gadget idea with a slick design, my wallet is already halfway open. So, damn you, concept design blogs! K shared the <a href="http://www.dinosaursandrobots.com/2009/08/linos-usb-record-player.html">link</a> to this simple, slick, and extremely cool <a href="http://www.dinosaursandrobots.com/2009/08/linos-usb-record-player.html">USB turntable</a> idea on Google Reader, and I could find nary a link to purchase. Ugh. Well, if this ever reaches mass marketing, I will gladly test it out. It is admittedly not for audiophiles, as it is clearly heavy on the convenience and showy design while a bit light on the technological specifications. But, still, it&#8217;s very cool. I could play records at work with one of these. Ok, so playing vinyl at work is beyond impractical, but I would still really want to try it.		</p>

<p>Prince has some of the most loyal fans of any artist I can think of, but even some of those freaks would surely be hard-pressed to fork over $2,100 for a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/04/13/limited-edition-prince-opus-ipod-just-wants-your-kiss-and-2-10/">limited edition iPod Touch</a>. Purple though it may be with that androgynous symbol engraved on the back, it only comes pre-loaded with one 15-song, 40 minute concert. Do what now? I could almost understand the price tag if this thing came jam-packed with not only every Prince record ever but also loads of rarities on multiple media formats. But for just one lousy concert? No way. There are only 950 of these bad boys floating around out there, so, if you&#8217;re a Prince completist, my apologies.		</p>
