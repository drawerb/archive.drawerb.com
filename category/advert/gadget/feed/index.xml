I&#8217;m a big fan of gadgets, especially those that relate to music. So, when you combine a cool gadget idea with a slick design, my wallet is already halfway open. So, damn you, concept design blogs! K shared the <a href="http://www.dinosaursandrobots.com/2009/08/linos-usb-record-player.html">link</a> to this simple, slick, and extremely cool <a href="http://www.dinosaursandrobots.com/2009/08/linos-usb-record-player.html">USB turntable</a> idea on Google Reader, and I could find nary a link to purchase. Ugh. Well, if this ever reaches mass marketing, I will gladly test it out. It is admittedly not for audiophiles, as it is clearly heavy on the convenience and showy design while a bit light on the technological specifications. But, still, it&#8217;s very cool. I could play records at work with one of these. Ok, so playing vinyl at work is beyond impractical, but I would still really want to try it.		</p>

<p>Prince has some of the most loyal fans of any artist I can think of, but even some of those freaks would surely be hard-pressed to fork over $2,100 for a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/04/13/limited-edition-prince-opus-ipod-just-wants-your-kiss-and-2-10/">limited edition iPod Touch</a>. Purple though it may be with that androgynous symbol engraved on the back, it only comes pre-loaded with one 15-song, 40 minute concert. Do what now? I could almost understand the price tag if this thing came jam-packed with not only every Prince record ever but also loads of rarities on multiple media formats. But for just one lousy concert? No way. There are only 950 of these bad boys floating around out there, so, if you&#8217;re a Prince completist, my apologies.		</p>

<p>Teac&#8217;s version of the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5078329/teacs-lp+r500-cd+equipped-record-player-fell-through-ugly-timewarp">clunky all in one CD/Cassette/Vinyl recorder</a> is not only hideous to look at but also ridiculously priced at $700. These things are notoriously of shitty quality, but sometimes the lazy way is the only way. I&#8217;ve been wanting to digitize some cassettes for a long time, and while I know there are higher quality ways to hook up a component cassette deck to a sound card, the complication and time expense has been to great to surmount. So, these crappy all-in-one solutions usually win out, despite whatever audio quality you may sacrifice in the long run. But I&#8217;m not paying $700. That $400 piece of shit from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MSAORO?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&#038;tag=nextag-ce-tier3-delta-20&#038;linkCode=asn">Crosley</a> isn&#8217;t looking so bad right now.		</p>

The new platter makes the process of digitizing your 7&#8243; collection slightly easier, since the built-in software transfers the data without any additional hardware or know-how. The built-in software also detects song gaps and individualizes the songs for you.It records onto USB flash drive, SD card, or a computer for $228. I may be hard-pressed to upgrade since I have the original USB version, but it would be slick not to have to separate tracks manually. It still comes with Audacity for post-editing, and so far it&#8217;s available only in the UK.</p>
