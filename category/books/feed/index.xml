										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://media.drawerb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/media/2009/01/depechemode.jpg"></a> I’ve been a <a href="http://www.depechemode.com/">Depeche Mode</a> fan since I was a kid. It was my gateway band to bigger and better things, but I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for it, even for the not-so-great albums (like the past decade’s worth). Well, 2005’s <em>Playing the Angel</em> wasn’t all bad. “Precious” was a good single, if entirely self-derivative of the <em>Violator</em> sound. So, I greet each new DM album with the same ho-hum attitude, hoping that this time it will, perhaps, be better. They haven’t angered me to the point that The Cure has with its relentlessly repetitive formula and increasingly awful lyrical insipidness (not to mention shameful collaborations), where I refuse to pay attention anymore. I think the problem is I’m not 15 anymore, and what originally appealed to me about Depeche Mode doesn’t register the same way. Yet, I’m tied to them by some subconsciously nostalgic grip. I’m still reverent towards the early albums, and I still love Dave Gahan’s voice. I just don’t drop everything and rush to the record store on release day, which <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/depeche-mode/42402">turns out to be April 21, 2009</a> for DM’s 12th studio album, <em>Sounds of the Universe</em>. Terrible title. Not a good sign. Still, I’m open to be impressed. The first single, “Wrong” (much better title), is out two weeks prior on April 6th.</p>
<p>Tracklist:</p>
<p>In Chains    <br />Hole To Feed     <br />Wrong     <br />Fragile Tension     <br />Little Soul     <br />In Sympathy     <br />Peace     <br />Come Back     <br />Spacewalker     <br />Perfect     <br />Miles Away / The Truth Is     <br />Jezebel     <br />Corrupt </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<a href="http://media.drawerb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/media/2008/09/dfw.jpg"></a> Josh Ferris, author of one of last year&#8217;s finest novels, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Then We Came to the End</span>, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/sep/21/david.foster.wallace.books">recalls his days</a> as a student news reporter when he had the opportunity to interview David Foster Wallace for the Daily Iowan.</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some recollections from my interview: he shared his office with another teacher; he drove a beat-to-hell Volkswagen; we ate pizza by the slice at a place on campus. To my inquiry, smug and innocent, on why he still lived in the midwest and not in New York City, where all the Great Writers lived, he said, equally innocently, &#8216;I love the midwest.&#8217; When we stepped into his VW, he apologised for its state of disarray and its bad muffler. On my offer to pay for his pizza, he said, &#8216;No, no, save your money. You&#8217;re still a student.&#8217; On my journalistic method, he remarked, &#8216;I&#8217;ve never known a reporter who didn&#8217;t use a tape recorder.&#8217; I have little doubt that by then he knew what sort of &#8216;journalist&#8217; I was, and yet, as we ate and talked and I took down notes (on Infinite Jest: &#8216;I wrote it between episodes of cleaning out my refrigerator&#8217;), he treated me as if I were Edmund Wilson.</p></blockquote>
<p>David Foster Wallace, author of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Broom of the System</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Infinite Jest</span>, hanged himself on Friday, September 12, 2008.		</p>
