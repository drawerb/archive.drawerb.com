<p>Hearing that a band is from Brooklyn may predetermine your attitude towards it, but good music rises above petty biases, good or bad. Soren Well is a quintet from the aforementioned trendy borough that plays a frighteningly accurate amalgamation of <em>Loveless</em>-era shoegaze with showers of guitars and dreamscape vocals. The tonal similarities to My Bloody Valentine&#8217;s career-defining album are almost overwhelming. Upon first listening to &#8220;After&#8221;, I just harped on all the noises and bended tremolos I could pick out that sounded like they were sampled straight from <em>Loveless</em>. But the more I listened, the less that bothered me because the music overtakes you with its monolithic hypnosis. The new songs the band has recently posted to its <a href="http://www.myspace.com/sorenwellnoise">MySpace</a> page will immediately trigger a reflexive comparison to MBV&#8217;s layered, moody architecture. It&#8217;s unavoidable. But there&#8217;s enough going on under the surface to avoid a knee-jerk dismissal. Soren Well is really good at reproducing these moods and sounds that you&#8217;re already very familiar with. So, even with docking for originality points, the band still comes out in the black just based on sheer talent and sonic mass. It&#8217;s quite a racket, but one that you will cling to as your ears bleed.</p>

<p>So, I was just browsing for records recently at <a href="http://www.lunchboxrecords.com/">Lunchbox Records</a> in Charlotte, NC (an awesome record store, by the way) when I happened across a 7&#8243; by a band called Cotton Candy. The clerk had written &#8220;Mark Robinson&#8221; on a sticker above the price tag, which is why I picked it up. Well, because of that and the cool artwork. Mark Robinson, as you may well know, owns <a href="http://www.teenbeatrecords.com/">Teenbeat</a> records, home of one of my favorite defunct bands, <a href="http://www.myspace.com/unrestffrr">Unrest</a>, which Robinson also fronted. As an avid collector of all things Unrest, I must admit it had been a while since I&#8217;d been aware of any of Robinson&#8217;s creative outlets. Last time I checked in was with the stilted post-punk of <a href="http://www.myspace.com/flinflon">Flin Flon</a>, but even that&#8217;s been a while. So I was excited to hear what he&#8217;s been up to. Cotton Candy stays in the jangly indie pop world Robinson has inhabited on and off for two decades. His half-spoken choirboy voice leads the charge over clean guitars. The other half of Cotton Candy, Evelyn Hurley, adds equally clean backing vocals. Underpinned by stuttering electronic flutters, &#8220;Fantastic Spectacular&#8221; evolves into a strangely synthetic experimentation, replete with vocoder and spooky, muted voices. Definitely worth checking out, if you&#8217;re a fan of any of Robinson&#8217;s previous work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				A dear friend sent me the Lily Allen Secret London Gig details today and while I&#8217;d love to see Ms. Allen again, I&#8217;m just far too slack to go to all the trouble necessary to get to the show.</p>
<p>1) Please bring ID.  [ok, that&#8217;s pretty easy.  Even I can manage that.]<br />
2) Please bring a print out of your mySpace profile. [seriously?  a print out?  Come on.]<br />
3) It&#8217;s a small gig, so don&#8217;t be slack.  Once it&#8217;s full, it&#8217;s full.  [fair point.  The hordes will be in full force for sure.]<br />
4) The theme is London Tube Stations.  Dress up.  As an added bonus, the people who dress up the very best will win a meet and greet après-show.  [ A costume?! in May?!]</p>
<p>Not to mention that I&#8217;d need to go all the way across town to Portabello Market Tent and then be swept away by the Magical MySpace Bus or Coach or whatever to the secret Venue.  Thanks, but no thanks.</p>
<p>Though, the Tube Themed costume does give me some ideas for next Halloween.		</p>

<p>I have found no band to fill the void left by <a href="http://www.myspace.com/corpsepose">Unwound</a>. I can&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ve been broken up for seven years. This clip is of &#8220;All Souls Day&#8221; off their second album (technically, their third if you count that self-titled Honey Bear release) <em>New Plastic Ideas</em>; no idea when this footage was recorded, but it doesn&#8217;t matter. The nuances are always harder to discern in a live setting, but this band&#8217;s depth and complexity was second to none in this strain of West Coast post-hardcore. Bassist Vern Rumsey has since dabbled in a few bands, most recently playing with <a href="http://www.myspace.com/floravfauna">Flora v. Fauna</a>, but the &#8220;About&#8221; section of the band&#8217;s MySpace doesn&#8217;t make it seem like all is well: &#8220;Well, is [sic] was fun while it lasted&#8230; sometimes is [sic] wasn&#8217;t though.&#8221;  And drummer Sara Lund has been playing with Portland&#8217;s <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hungryghostpdx">Hungry Ghost</a>. Can&#8217;t seem to find any information on guitarist/vocalist Justin Trosper. Only a rumor that he&#8217;s putting out a solo record called <em>Teutonic Plates and Other Delights</em>. Utterly unconfirmed, though.</p>

<p>Cursive&#8217;s &#8220;From the Hips&#8221; took a few listens before I became obsessed with it. Now, I simply can&#8217;t get enough. Their <a href="http://www.drawerb.com/2009/03/15/cursive-from-the-hips-on-the-late-show-with-david-letterman-03132009/"> wildly raucous recent performance on Letterman</a> sealed the deal for me. Tim Kasher&#8217;s had the dynamics game in his pocket for years, but now he&#8217;s able to spin a yarn that&#8217;s not claustrophobic and one-dimensionally self-obsessed. The video for the first single off <em>Mama, I&#8217;m Swollen</em> (album title of the year, thus far) was directed by Michael Grodner, who also directed Cursive&#8217;s <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/839209">excellent </a>&#8220;Dorothy at 40.&#8221; It overtly satirizes Kasher&#8217;s distaste for predictable, expected, and paralyzing social humdrum, wherein the only redemption is, evidently, fucking. </p>
