I still remember the very first time I heard Blank Wave Arcade. It was in the Fall of 1999. We had received it as a promo <a href="http://www.drawerb.com/1998/12/31/the-faint-blank-wave-arcade-saddle-creek/">for review</a>. Eric knew right away that I would love it. And fall in love I did. 13 years later it is still one of my all-time favorite albums, combining my unabashed love of synths, drum machines, and 3 minute songs. How I managed to make it 13 years without seeing <a href="http://www.thefaint.com/">The Faint</a> is a mystery. Tours never seemed to line up with my nomadic proclivities. But, I&#8217;m happy to say it was well worth the wait. In addition to blazing through <a href="http://saddle-creek.com/store/550">Danse Macabre</a>, the subject of reissue and remastering and the raison de tour, the band treated the packed club to classics such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsZARnf6uAY">Mote</a> (a Sonic Youth cover), Call Call and the sing-along <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv5kKvDwv_c">Worked Up So Sexual</a>. Wrapping up the evening with crowd pleasers I Disappear, and Paranoiattack. The very appreciative crowd spanned several generations, linked by a love of this band from Omaha who alone have managed to blend the punk ethos with new wave sensibilities for over a decade now.		</p>

&#8220;This is so bad!  Itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s not even music&#8230;&#8221; cried a drunk, self-proclaimed &#8220;Clapton fan&#8221; and likely GWU student as the wall of sound from the opener, Run into Flowers, tumbled and faded while the crowd went nuts.  I donâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t think that unwitting student was prepared for the aural crush of an <a href="http://www.ilovem83.com/">M83</a> show, particularly 5 feet from the speakers.  To be fair, I wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t prepared for the crush, either.  In fact, I wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t really sure what to expect from this latter day electronic Spector.  I was secretly delighted to see the drums and guitars on stage upon arrival, having attended many a show where the &#8220;band&#8221; twiddled knobs from behind a giant kit of electronic equipment (Though, to be fair, Squarepusher puts on a hell of a show from behind his rack).  Of course, the requisite rack of knobs and keyboards was indeed present on stage.</p>
<p>Based on the lack of on stage banter and the methodically smooth flow of things, particularly the triggering of samples, the show was most definitely pre-sequenced.  Not unheard of and fortunately in this case, not to its detriment.  With 4 people on stage all banging away at their instruments (Anthony on both guitar and keyboard/knobs), it was easy to forget there was a script.  To say that the songs sounded just like the records would be a disservice, they werenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t simply facsimiles, they were enormous, colossal live instrumentations of their epic recorded companions.  Recent hits Kim &#038; Jessie and Graveyard Girl ensconced the audience in their sonic warm blanket of retro reminiscence, inspiring many a couple to embrace within eyeshot.  And from the response of the crowd, most were there to hear those two songs.  In fact, several tracks from Saturdays = Youth made the cut, as might be expected what with the huge marketing push from Mute, which includes a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/group/m83">video contest</a>, a &#8220;<a href="http://widget.nabbr.com/m83.html">widget</a>&#8221; contest, a <a href="http://www.mute.com/allNews.jsp?newsParentId=55343&#038;topItemId=8880152">re-release of all 5 albums</a> on vinyl, a headlining US tour as well as an <a href="http://www.mute.com/allNews.jsp?newsParentId=55343&#038;topItemId=8881222">international tour</a> with <a href="http://www.drawerb.com/2005/06/30/kings-of-leon-aha-shake-heartbreak-rca/">Kings of Leon</a>.
