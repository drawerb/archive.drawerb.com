<p>Something like 75% of <a href="http://www.condenast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CondÃ© Nast</a>â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s most venerable publicationâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s readership &#8211; the always studious, perpetually thorough <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> &#8211; doesnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t even live on the island theyâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re reading about.

When it comes to art, music, theatre and books though, the magazineâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s equally studious, equally thorough critics are usually beyond reproach. Throw in some fiction by Updike and T. Coraghessan Boyle, and youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve got yourself one helluva imposing rag dog-eared there in the wicker basket &#8211; between this monthâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s <a href="http://www.viceland.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vice</em></a> and an old, â€œlove wornâ€ copy of <a href="http://www.screwmagforever.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Screw</em></a> &#8211; right beside the can.</p>
<p>That is, until I read whatever schlop film critic Anthony Lane schtarts schlinginâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> around there in the back pages. In a review split down the middle, word-count wise, with Wes Andersonâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s newest familial joint <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/thedarjeelinglimited/trailerb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>,</a> Lane readily admits that while heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s never even heard of the very band whose very lead singer is the very subject of the very film heâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s getting very paid to see, I should still gas up my big-as-a-whale Chrysler and head down the Atlanta Highway to catch <a href="http://www.drawerb.com/2007/10/08/the-only-review-of-control-that-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Control</em> </a>at <a href="http://www.landmarktheatres.com/market/Atlanta/MidtownArtCinema.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midtown Art Cinema</a> Friday, November 2nd:</p>
<p>â€œSpeaking as someone so irretrievably square that I not only never listened to the band but didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t even know anyone who liked it, I canâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t imagine a tribute more fitting than this.â€</p>
<p><span id="more-2465"></span></p>
<p>Really, Tony? You mean to tell me that all that time you wasted reading Eliot at Oxbridge, you never once ventured northwest to Macclesfield? Fuck, thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s a wasteland for ya. And all that time you spent on assignment for <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Independent</em></a>, you never dropped Ecstasy in Madchester? Youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re loss, I suppose. But to state grosse pointe blank in a review that you havenâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t done your homework negates nearly everything you have to say about the subject. Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />d really like to believe you when you write that Anton Corbijnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s film features Sam Riley as a â€œdreamy schoolboy, posing shirtless in front of the bedroom mirror, mouthing along to Bowieâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s â€˜Jean Genie,â€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />â€ but how can I be sure? For all you know ass clown it could be Shaun Ryder popping zits to Jean Genet.		</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<a href="http://media.drawerb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/2007/10/07reyn600.jpg" title="Joy Division"></a></p>
<p>Simon Reynolds <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/movies/07reyn.html?_r=1&amp;ref=movies&amp;oref=slogin">clearly understands</a> Joy Division&#8217;s music, mystery, and cultural significance, as evidenced by his impressive review of Anton Corbijn&#8217;s biopic, <a href="http://momentum.control.substance001.com/Main.html">Control</a>, in yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a>. In fact, there are few other writers I&#8217;d want to read on the subject:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yet thereâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s one crucial factor mentioned in <u>Touching From a Distance</u> that &#8216;Control&#8217; strangely ignores: Mr. Curtisâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s romantic fascination with rock stars who died young. In the book Ms. Curtis writes that her husband told her he had &#8216;no intention of living beyond his early 20s.&#8217; This apparent death wish suggests that amid the depression and confusion, there was an aesthetic component to his fatal decision. From his teenage infatuation with glam rock to the attention he paid to record design, Mr. Curtis appreciated the power of gesture. Because his suicide preceded the release of <em>Closer</em>, it determined the albumâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s immediate reception and its long-term resonance. (In â€œThe Eternalâ€, the narrator watches a funeral procession â€” his own?) It could be that Mr. Curtis planned it that way. He played a major role in choosing the albumâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s cover, a photograph of a sculpture tableau in a cemetery of the dead Christ surrounded by mourners.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>This <a href="http://www.kurtcobainaboutason.com/">documentary </a>is based on 25 hours of audio-taped interviews conducted by noted Cobain biographer Michael Azerrad, who also wrote the American post-punk, pre-grunge, underground rock history tome, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Our-Band-Could-Your-Life/dp/0316063797">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a>. 25 hours of audio-taped interviews given to one person? Jesus. From the looks of the trailer, it&#8217;s likely this film will be far less confusing and esoteric than Gus Van Sant&#8217;s loosely based Cobain biopic <a href="http://www.lastdaysmovie.com/">Last Days</a>, since Cobain&#8217;s voice narrates the entire film. My only hesitation is the cinematic aspect- just seeing random images, artfully filmed as they may be, as Cobain speaks might be disconcerting.		</p>

<p>Southland Tales, Richard Kelly&#8217;s follow up to the sleeper hit Donnie Darko, finally has a <a href="http://www.movieweb.com/video/V07I9agqwHIJNX">trailer</a> (on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38KYGuQwP08">youtube</a>, too).</p>
<blockquote><p>Southland Tales is an ensemble piece set in the futuristic landscape of Los Angeles on July 4, 2008, as it stands on the brink of social, economic and environmental disaster. Boxer Santaros is an action star who&#8217;s stricken with amnesia. His life intertwines with Krysta Now, an adult film star developing her own reality television project, and David Clark, a Hermosa Beach police officer who holds the key to a vast conspiracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Starring The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Sean William Scott, Mandy Moore, as well as Nora Dunn, Christopher Lambert, John Larroquette, Jon Lovitz, Amy Poehler, Miranda Richardson, Kevin Smith and Justin Timberlake.</p>
<p>A wave of mutilation, indeed.</p>
