<p>Harkening back to the mid-90s, Sony/Legacy is <a href="https://www.legacyrecordings.com/2019/08/01/the-prince-estate-in-partnership-with-legacy-recordings-announces-next-wave-of-titles-in-definitive-prince-reissue-project-coming-friday-september-13/">reissuing</a> the first batch of albums released just after Prince had changed his name to the Love Symbol (O(+&gt;) for the first time ever on vinyl. These albums have been out of print for decades and come with exorbitant prices on the collector&#8217;s market.</p>



<p><em>The Versace Experience (Prelude 2 Gold)</em> was originally handed out as a cassette mix-tape for Paris Fashion Week back in 1995 and served as a preview of <em>The Gold Experience</em>. It was reissued on cassette earlier this year as a <a href="https://recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/10571">Record Store Day exclusive</a>.  Hopefully, the sound issues on that cassette reissue have been addressed for this vinyl edition.</p>



<span id="more-7841"></span>



<p>Next up is <em>Chaos and Disorder</em>, which was Prince&#8217;s middle finger to Warner Bros.- a contractually obligated compilation of &#8220;vault&#8221; tracks that were &#8220;originally intended for private use only&#8221; and that Prince famously refused to promote (although he did play &#8220;Dinner with Delores&#8221; on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2457856387611348">Today Show</a> in summer 1996). Long considered a throwaway album, <em>Chaos and Disorder</em> is criminally underrated. It&#8217;s Prince&#8217;s angriest, most rocking, guitar-centric album of the 90s.</p>



<p>And rounding out the reissues is <em>Emancipation</em>, Prince&#8217;s official debut as a &#8220;free man&#8221; from the confines record contracts and, specifically, Warner Bros. Records. It&#8217;s a triple album spread across six pieces of vinyl that showcases every aspect of Prince&#8217;s songwriting prowess. Despite its obvious need for an editor and some production variance, <em>Emancipation </em>stands as one of Prince&#8217;s defining moments. </p>



<p>You can sample Pussy Control (Club Mix) from <em>The Versace Experience (Prelude 2 Gold)</em> below now, and pre-order the records <a href="https://store.prince.com/dept/legacy-reissues?cp=103229_104317">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://spaceoddity50.davidbowie.com/">David Bowie&#8217;s estate</a> has just released an official video to accompany the 2019 mix by longtime producer Tony Visconti of &#8220;Space Oddity,&#8221; which was Bowie&#8217;s first big hit released 50 years ago this month.  To the chagrin of some fans, the footage mixes eras of Bowie&#8217;s career. This was a song that he kept in sets throughout all of his chameleonic musical and artistic shifts so to complain of the blended eras seems a bit short-sighted. </p>



<p>To further capitalize on the semicentennial anniversary of Bowie&#8217;s career launch, a 7&#8243; box set has recently <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07RJZ127C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">been issued</a>, featuring the original mono release as well as the new 2019 mixes housed in new picture sleeves complete with a double-sided poster.  </p>



<ul class="is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure></figure></li></ul>



<p>

Bowie&#8217;s estate has released a glut of small-scale rarities this year but still no word on the next catalog box set, covering his musical rebound in the 1990s.

<p>A definitive version of Silkworm&#8217;s 1994 classic <em>In The West</em> is forthcoming from Comedy Minus One records.

The physical release will be on double vinyl with re-imagined artwork and limited to 1500 copies. A bonus CD completes the package featuring 7&#8243; b-sides and a live version of &#8220;Halloween.&#8221; This streaming version of album highlight &#8220;Dremate&#8221; is limited to the download accompaniment to the <a href="https://www.comedyminusone.com/2019/03/11/details-on-preorders-for-the-silkworm-2x12-cd-in-the-west-reissue/">bundle</a>. <br><br>Despite being released in the midst of college radio&#8217;s halcyon days, this record has never before been released on vinyl. Mindblowingly, Silkworm also released <em>Libterine </em>later that same year.       </p>

<p>The Original Soundtrack from the Ryan Gosling film <a href="http://www.drive-movie.com/">Drive</a> is being re-released on a special gatefold, double-LP set with new artwork by poster artist <a href="http://www.tstout.com/">Tyler Stout</a> (above) on black vinyl. Random copies will be pressed on hot pink vinyl, however. I never win that lottery, so I expect my copy to be black. But I&#8217;m excited, nonetheless, because the music is what pushed this film from great to bad ass for me. The OST features a score by composer Cliff Martinez, as well as unshakably memorable songs by Kavinsky, Chromatics, and College. This reissue is available for purchase via Austin&#8217;s <a href="http://mondotees.com/">Mondo Gallery</a> on March 22, 2013. None of the streaming sites carry this soundtrack, so your options are limited.
