										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<a href="http://media.drawerb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/media/2014/10/photo026.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Last week, Mark Kozelek seemingly joked that he&#8217;d written a song called <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/56916-mark-kozelek-challenges-the-war-on-drugs-to-let-him-join-them-onstage/">&#8220;War on Drugs: Suck My Cock.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I challenge War On Drugs to let me join them onstage and play a hilarious song I&#8217;ve written called &#8216;War On Drugs: Suck My Cock/Sun Kil Moon: Go Fuck Yourself&#8217; at the Fillmore, October 6,&#8221; Kozelek wrote in on his website (in a post that seems to have since been deleted), &#8220;provided they let me handle the beer commercial lead guitar.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wasn&#8217;t joking. Kozelek <a href="http://sunkilmoon.com/mkwod/index.html">released the song</a> to his Sun Kil Moon website at midnight EST, presumably right before The War on Drugs took the stage at its sold-out show at The Fillmore in San Francisco. In addition to repeatedly inviting the Philadelphia band to &#8220;suck my cock,&#8221; he talks about the Sun Kil Moon Hopscotch performance where he called the crowd <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/56628-mark-kozeleks-label-selling-all-you-fuckin-hillbillies-shut-the-fuck-up-t-shirt/">&#8220;fuckin&#8217; hillbillies.&#8221;</a> (He&#8217;s still <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/56628-mark-kozeleks-label-selling-all-you-fuckin-hillbillies-shut-the-fuck-up-t-shirt/">selling T-shirts</a> emblazoned with the slogan.)</p>
<p>The War on Drugs dudes, Kozelek concedes, are &#8220;pretty nice,&#8221; but &#8220;definitely the whitest fuckin&#8217; band I&#8217;ve ever heard.&#8221; &#8220;Sounded like basic John Fogerty rock,&#8221; he sings, and, later: &#8220;The War on Drugs loves John Mellencamp.&#8221; Also: &#8220;Bridge-and-tunnel people<i> love</i> them some War on Drugs.&#8221; Burn, yo.</p>
<p>The song is actually, as Kozelek claimed it would be, kind of hilarious — whether it&#8217;s intentional or because it paints Kozelek as an increasingly crochety, curmudgeonly dude. For instance, he follows up following up a line about The War on Drugs&#8217; &#8220;beer commercial lead guitar&#8221; by yelping &#8220;Wait, there&#8217;s more!&#8221; and deploying a harmonized dual-guitar line. After needling the band with &#8220;To make three albums, took &#8217;em nine fuckin&#8217; years!,&#8221; a canned audience applauds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all tongue-in-cheek: He lashes out at <a href="http://www.indyweek.com/music/archives/2014/09/06/hopscotch-night-two-a-picnic"><em>Indyweek</em> writer Allison Hussey</a> with the particularly vituperative couplet &#8220;Someone got offended and wrote a piece of crap / Some spoiled bitch rich kid blogger brat.&#8221; Not cool, Kozzy.</p>
<p>The War on Drugs, meanwhile, have yet to respond with a song called &#8220;Sun Kil Moon: Go Fuck Yourself.&#8221; I&#8217;d pay to hear that one.</p>
<p><a href="http://sunkilmoon.com/mkwod/index.html">Stream the song</a> from Sun Kil Moon&#8217;s website, or <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/56989-here-it-is-mark-kozeleks-song-called-war-on-drugs-suck-my-cock/">download</a> it from Pitchfork.		</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				<a href="http://media.drawerb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/media/2014/03/Nirvana1.png"></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s one big sticking for eligibility for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (outside of that whole, y&#8217;know, being <em>good</em> and <em>import</em><em>ant</em> thing). As in baseball, it&#8217;s all about time: To qualify for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, there must be a passing of 25 years since the band&#8217;s first release.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been exactly 25 years since Nirvana released <em>Bleach</em>, and if there are few first-ballot decisions as no-brainer as Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl.</p>
<p>But Grohl didn&#8217;t play on <em>Bleach</em>. Chad Channing did. (He&#8217;s the guy on the far right in the above picture.)</p>
<p>But Chad Channing isn&#8217;t getting inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Worse, he found out via text message.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell whoever looks after Chad Channing that he isn’t being inducted,&#8221; the Rock Hall wrote to Nirvana&#8217;s manager, reports radio.com. &#8220;It is just Dave, Krist and Kurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cold. Blooded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ll be there at the table ready to walk up,&#8221; Channing told the site in an earlier interview about Nirvana&#8217;s imminent induction. &#8220;When I told my daughter about the induction, she was super excited for me! So much of my excitement about it is for her!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>COLD. BLOODED.</strong> I haven&#8217;t been this upset about a Hall of Fame snub since Tim &#8220;Rock&#8221; Raines.</p>
<p>(Then again, if the Hall inducts Chad Channing, shouldn&#8217;t it induct Dale Crover, who played on <em>Bleach</em>&#8216;s &#8220;Floyd the Barber&#8221;, &#8220;Paper Cuts&#8221; and &#8220;Downer&#8221;? Then again, isn&#8217;t the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame kind of stupid to begin with?)</p>
<p>The Hall of Fame induction ceremony is April 10 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.		</p>

<p>To paraphrase Walt Whitman: Does Prince contradict himself? Very well, then. He is large, and he contains multitudes.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/prince-files-lawsuit-over-links-to-music-file-sharing-sites/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0"><em>The New York Times</em> reported</a> that two weeks ago Prince Rogers Nelson filed a lawsuit — well, his lawyers did on his behalf, anyway — against 22 bootleggers who allegedly posted unauthorized recordings of his concerts to peer-to-peer sharing sites and their Facebook pages. The timestamp on the most recent update to the <em>Times</em> story reads 4:11 p.m. EST. (Oh, and</p>
<p>But not more than three hours later, The Purple One changed his mind, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/01/28/prince-drops-22-million-lawuit-bootleggers-music/">TMZ reported</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, he also dropped a teaser of &#8220;PRETZELBODYLOGIC,&#8221; a song from his 3rd Eye Girl collaboration with Donna Grantis, Hannah Ford and Ida Neilsen. You can hear the 30-second clip above.</p>
<p>The lesson, as always: Prince moves in mysterious ways.		</p>
