<p>The Pixies — now with <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/pixies-hire-touring-bassist-paz-lenchatin-20131209">100 percent more Paz Lenchnatin</a>! — released to <a href="http://www.pixiesmusic.com/ep2-us/">their website</a> yesterday a new EP. The oh-so-cleverly named <em>EP-2</em> is the follow-up to last year&#8217;s abysmal <em>EP-1</em>. (Which, if you&#8217;re anything like me, you were able to block from your mind with repeated listens to &#8220;Distance Equals Rate Times Time.&#8221;)</p>
<p>If nothing else, &#8220;Blue-Eyed Hexe,&#8221; the video for which is above, is miles better than the awful, awful &#8220;Bagboy.&#8221; It even starts off in classic late-era Pixies form: The herky-jerk tempo and meaty power chords and Frank Black&#8217;s monotone delivery are reminiscent of &#8220;UMass.&#8221; The chorus is kind of drekky, all cock-rock sleaze, but there&#8217;s a reason for that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gil [Norton, who produced the EP] wanted a swagger,&#8221; says Pixies guitarist Joey Santiago, &#8220;he wanted the guitar solo to sound like you&#8217;re going to have sex with this blue-eyed hexe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that explains that, I guess. (Snark aside, the solo&#8217;s actually one of Santiago&#8217;s better in-recent-memory solos.)</p>
<p><em>EP-2</em> is available for download on the Pixies website. The Pixies are on tour in Canadan and the states through March — the northern dates get FIDLAR as the opener; the Southeast and Midwest get Cults; and the West Coast gets Best Coast.		</p>

<p>I often have to be in the mood to listen to certain bands, but one band I can put on regardless what I&#8217;m doing or how I&#8217;m feeling is Stereolab. There&#8217;s something about Laetitia Sadier’s voice that just mesmerizes me. Her solo work is slightly more intimate and freer than Stereolab&#8217;s syncopated, droning machinations.

<p>For his second solo LP, Interpol&#8217;s Paul Banks has abandoned his Julian Plenti alias in favor of his own name. The album, entitled <em>Banks</em>, will be out October 23, 2012 on <a href="http://www.matadorrecords.com/matablog/2012/08/06/coming-october-23-the-new-paul-banks-album-banks/">Matador Records</a>, home to all but one Interpol record. Having such a distinctive voice is a bit of a double edged sword for singers in high profile bands who embark on solo careers. Most people will simply say, &#8220;eh, it just sounds like Interpol.&#8221; Well, yes, but also not really.

<p>The Lemonheads are gearing up for a <a href="http://www.slicingupeyeballs.com/2011/07/12/lemonheads-its-a-shame-about-ray-tour-dates/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+SlicingUpEyeballs+(slicing+up+eyeballs:+'80s+college,+indie,+alternative+rock+music)">tour</a> supporting or celebrating (but more likely cashing in on) an album that came out 19 years ago. <em>It&#8217;s A Shame About Ray</em> is founding member Evan Dando&#8217;s unquestionable masterpiece. Never has he put together a collection of such effortless, memorable, and affecting folk-pop. Despite Dando&#8217;s notorious struggles with drugs over the years and his inability to gain any lasting traction with subsequent albums, fans will likely come out of the woodwork to hear this record performed in its entirety. The Lemonheads is and has always been Dando, so the musicians backing him are neither here nor there in terms of reunion authenticity. What&#8217;s of more concern is Dando&#8217;s mental state, which, according to <a href="http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/68806/">this</a> New York Magazine feature, does not seem promising. But, he and longtime friend Juliana Hatfield successfully made it through a batch of recent <a href="http://www.spinner.com/2011/06/17/evan-dando-juliana-hatfield-nxne/">shows</a> where they took turns playing each other&#8217;s songs in an acoustic setting. So, here&#8217;s to hoping Dando has his shit together, so that he can showcase this record in a way in which it deserves.</p>

<p>Whether or not your down with Joy Division bassist Peter Hook touring his old band&#8217;s debut album with his kid and a few hired guns in tow is one thing. Purchasing an <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/42248-peter-hook-unearths-unfinished-joy-division-track-for-new-ep-tours-full-joy-division-albums/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+PitchforkLatestNews+(Pitchfork:+Latest+News)">EP of Joy Division covers</a> by said crew is another. I couldn&#8217;t imagine patronizing either one. But somebody must be, or I wouldn&#8217;t keep reading about it. (And I&#8217;m not helping either, obviously). The new EP <em>1102 / 2011</em> by Peter Hook and The Light featuring Rowetta (ex-Happy Mondays) tricks out new versions of the Joy Division classics &#8220;Atmosphere,&#8221; &#8220;Insight,&#8221; and &#8220;New Dawn Fades,&#8221; as well as an unfinished Joy Division song evidently titled &#8220;Pictures in My Mind.&#8221; The latter song is obviously the bait for the completists. Clever trick. I for one can live without any of it. For the curious, it all hits shelves on May 9 on Hook&#8217;s own <a href="http://www.fac51thehacienda.com/">Hacienda Records</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re nostalgic to the point of obsession, then you can check out Hook et al. on tour, where they&#8217;ll not only be playing Joy Division&#8217;s <em>Unknown Pleasures</em> on certain dates but for a special show in Manchester on May 18th, the anniversary of Joy Division lead singer Ian Curtis&#8217; death, the group will perform Joy Division&#8217;s final recording, <em>Closer</em>, in its entirety. Dates after the break via <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/42248-peter-hook-unearths-unfinished-joy-division-track-for-new-ep-tours-full-joy-division-albums/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+PitchforkLatestNews+(Pitchfork:+Latest+News)">Pitchfork</a>.</p>

<p>Another new tune from Arctic Monkeys&#8217; fourth long-player, the curiously titled and <a href="http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/56245">shittily cover-art-ed</a> <em>Suck it and See</em>, shows the Sheffield quartet continuing its quest into the dark terrain trampled on the slightly dour <em>Humbug</em>. But as with even the worst Arctic Monkeys songs, there&#8217;s always Alex Turner&#8217;s showy wordplay to lessen the blow. Alas, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Sit Down Cause I&#8217;ve Moved Your Chair&#8221; is a far cry from the band&#8217;s worst. It sports a twisted, rocker riff replete with borderline shoegaze &#8220;oohs&#8221; and a dose of sunny harmonies. And more of Turner&#8217;s ace lyrics.</p>
<p>The band has two sweeps across the US planned over the next few months. However, if you live in the South, you&#8217;re foiled again.

<p><a href="http://bttls.com/gloss-drop/">Battles</a> has paired down to a three-piece, but the departure of multi-instrumentalist/vocalist Tyondai Braxton hasn&#8217;t quashed my excitement for the new record, <em>Gloss Drop</em>, one bit. (That album title, by the way, is the win). In fact, as long as Ian Williams is on board, I&#8217;m on board. The new record is out June 7th via <a href="http://warp.net/">Warp</a> and is to be followed by an extensive multi-continent tour spanning several months. If you fancy having your mind blown, try these guys live. Later this year the band will help curate <a href="http://www.atpfestival.com/">ATP</a>&#8216;s Nightmare Before Christmas with Caribou and Les Savy Fav.
