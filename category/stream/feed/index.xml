<p>Alt-rock singer/songwriter <a href="https://www.julianahatfield.com/">Juliana Hatfield</a> returns with her second record of 2019 with a tribute to the Police, covering a smattering of the trio&#8217;s classics and deeper cuts. This stands as Hatfield&#8217;s second covers record, having paid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliana_Hatfield_Sings_Olivia_Newton-John">tribute to Olivia Newton-John</a> back in 2018, and it&#8217;s a tradition she hopes to continue. She released the insular and reflective <em>Weird</em>, her 17th solo album, back in January of this year. Hatfield&#8217;s teaser for the upcoming covers record is her version of &#8220;De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da,&#8221; which suits her style amazingly well. I hadn&#8217;t previously heard a Police influence in her solo work, but I can&#8217;t un-hear it now. </p>



<p><em>Juliana Hatfield Sings The Police</em> is out in November on American Laundromat Records. You can pre-order it <a href="https://www.alr-music.com/collections/out-now/products/juliana-hatfield-sings-the-police">here</a>. </p>

<p>Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke has released his latest solo album, <em>A</em>NIMA, to streaming services. The <a href="https://anima.technology/">physical edition</a> comes out July 19. Yorke continues to explore his nervous dread of modern life over skittering, twitchy beats. It&#8217;s cautiously optimistic music that requires an attentive listener, despite being enveloped in existential unease. <br><br>Director Paul Thomas Anderson, who worked with Radiohead on the video for &#8220;Daydreaming,&#8221; has directed a short film to coincide with <em>ANIMA&#8217;s </em>release and features Yorke and actress Dajana Roncione. It is streaming now on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/81110498?trackId=13752289&amp;tctx=0%2C0%2C96fd2bca4c7dff70d7986211f0216dda9e4a1efd%3Af81999059d93109f224e7da4dd81a36ce4b53ad0%2C%2C">Netflix</a>. </p>

<p>A definitive version of Silkworm&#8217;s 1994 classic <em>In The West</em> is forthcoming from Comedy Minus One records. It has been remixed from the original two-inch tape by Steve Albini, who also served as the engineer on the initial recording sessions. The physical release will be on double vinyl with re-imagined artwork and limited to 1500 copies. A bonus CD completes the package featuring 7&#8243; b-sides and a live version of &#8220;Halloween.&#8221; This streaming version of album highlight &#8220;Dremate&#8221; is limited to the download accompaniment to the <a href="https://www.comedyminusone.com/2019/03/11/details-on-preorders-for-the-silkworm-2x12-cd-in-the-west-reissue/">bundle</a>. <br><br>Despite being released in the midst of college radio&#8217;s halcyon days, this record has never before been released on vinyl. Mindblowingly, Silkworm also released <em>Libterine </em>later that same year.       </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				</p>
<p>Christians have been awaiting the second coming of Jesus Christ for more than two millennia, now. Comparatively, we had to wait just under 15 years for <em>Black Messiah</em>.</p>
<p>Notoriously reclusive R&amp;B superstar D&#8217;Angelo quickly and quietly released <em>Black Messiah</em>, the long-awaited follow-up to 2000&#8217;s <em>Voodoo</em>, to iTunes and Spotify last night, after teasing the album over the weekend by dropping a 15-second album trailer on Friday and first single &#8220;Sugah Daddy&#8221; on Saturday.</p>
<p>Fifteen years is a long time to wait for a follow-up, and the track record for albums with such long waits, uh, isn&#8217;t good. (See: <em>Chinese Democracy</em>; <i>SMiLE</i>.) But damn if <em>Black Messiah</em>, on first listen, is well worth the delay. <em>Black Messiah</em> is a superlative funk record in the vein of Prince circa <em>Prince</em>, Sly circa <em>There&#8217;s a Riot Going On</em> and P-Funk circa &#8220;Maggot Brain,&#8221; thanks in large part to D&#8217;Angelo&#8217;s fierce and fluid backing band The Vanguard. &#8220;Sugah Daddy,&#8221; teased earlier in the weekend, is vintage D&#8217;Angelo, sexy and sprightly and playful. And the vicious, quasi-industrial &#8220;1000 Deaths&#8221; is already making me regret submitting my <em>Village Voice</em> Pazz + Jop ballot early.</p>
