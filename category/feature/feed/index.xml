										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				</p>
<p>It’s often hard for me to believe it when bands say they have no direct influences on their sound. And when I recently spoke with The Joy Formidable’s bassist, Rhydian Daffyd, I heard a familiar refrain: “Sometimes we feel like we live in a bubble.” Yeah, yeah. Bands always hem and haw when asked to describe their sound or list their favorite artists, so I always make a point to do so, just to see how much they squirm or if they’ll play along. Daffyd predictably begged off at first, but when pressed let slip quite a few. His list caught me off guard. While I was coming from a very narrow-minded and specific shoegaze angle with a little Curve and Britpop thrown in, he lobbed “Springsteen, Costello, Orbison, and Motown” back at me. Touché.</p>
<p><span id="more-6594"></span></p>
<p>His point was that his band didn’t have any preconceived notions about what it wanted to sound like when it began in 2007 other than wanting to be good, and that the artists that influenced it the most are the ones who focused on the songs, not image or sound. He also stressed how he and his bandmates grew up in an environment in Wales without the kind of access to new music that kids take for granted these days with the overwhelming limitlessness of the Internet. When he firmly asserted that his band’s sound is “secondary to the dynamic scope” I knew he was serious. So, I shouldn’t have been surprised by his conversational intensity, given how brazenly sharp and focused his band’s debut full-length is.</p>
<p>When I first heard The Joy Formidable’s “The Last Drop” off last year’s A Balloon Called Moaning EP, I knew instantly that I would love this band with its razor-sharp guitars, big booming choruses and a penchant for bombast that much of today’s trendier acts wouldn’t even know how to emulate. Ritzy Bryan’s voice cuts through the guitars with a piercing wail that recalls early 90’s Curve records, despite the fact that Daffyd claims ignorance on the subject of Curve (although he did acknowledge that I was not the first to mention the similarity). The band’s debut full-length, The Big Roar, takes the promise of “The Last Drop” and drives it to its logical conclusion on tracks like “Whirring” and “Cradle,” both of which employ whip-smart songwriting chops slathered in layers of guitars with an urgent backbone of bass.</p>
<p>Much of The Big Roar blurs the lines between aggression, melancholy and an underlying optimism. The in-the-red production underscores this trio’s power. Without such strong hooks, lesser bands would crumble under the weight of such sonic histrionics, but The Joy Formidable’s hooks soar amidst all the noise. It usually takes bands much longer than an EP and a full-length to achieve such swagger.</p>
<p>It’s so refreshing when bands find their way to people’s ears through word of mouth, instead of the tiresome hype cycle, where acts are vaulted and forgotten in the lapse of merely a semester. The Joy Formidable’s organic trajectory follows that of a band that came up in the 80’s, where the fan base grew in concert with the development of each each single or EP. It’s rare for bands to be allowed to develop naturally with the nanosecond attention spans of today’s micro-niche blog-culture.</p>
<p>The Joy Formidable has played the main stage at Glastonbury, one of the biggest, most renowned festivals in England, so I asked Daffyd if cracking America on that level was on the band’s to-do list. Daffyd stressed to me that commercial appeal is only “an after-thought”- that they would play their asses off for an empty club as much as for a field with hundreds of thousands of fans. The “we always give 100%” speech definitely means things are going well. I can’t imagine such enthusiasm if doors were being slammed at every turn.		</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>				Slate&#8217;s music critic, Jody Rosen, isn&#8217;t a big fan of The Decemberists. I, too, share Rosen&#8217;s distaste for the most pretentious little Lord Fauntleroy in all of corporate subsidized nerd folk in one Colin Meloy. His reedy voice &#8211; embarrassingly overwrought lyrics notwithstanding &#8211; is of a timbre my ears find repugnant. When I dislike something with as much enthusiasm as I dislike The Decemberists, it often clouds my ability to understand how anyone could not find it as loathsome as I do. So, when I happen upon someone with a like-minded viewpoint, I tend to revel in the mutual disgust. Rosen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2215819/?from=rss">piece today</a> lists the top eight most pretentious lyrics on The Decemberist&#8217;s new record, <em>The Hazards of Love</em>. Having avoided the new record at all costs, I can&#8217;t speak to the level of pretension inherent to Meloy&#8217;s latest set of pedantic poetry, but based on Meloy&#8217;s past flowery indulgences, I&#8217;d imagine Rosen had a hard time whittling the list down to only eight.</p>
<p>One example:</p>
<blockquote><p>4. From &#8220;The Abduction of Margaret&#8221;</p>
<p>All a&#8217;gallop with Margaret slung rude &#8216;cross withers<br />
Having clamped her innocent fingers in fetters<br />
This villain must calculate crossing the wild river!</p></blockquote>
<p>For some reason this make feel like Meloy deserves a cock punch. Just obnoxiously annoying. Imagine how unbelievably unfun it must be to hang out with this guy as he slurps mead from a pewter chalice and recites Chaucer. In <del datetime="2009-04-16T16:11:55+00:00">Old</del> Middle English.		</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://media.drawerb.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/media/2009/03/benkweller.jpg"></a> I just happened to be listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101302481">NPR</a> last night and caught an interview with Ben Kweller and was sort of taken aback how much his speaking voice sounds like his singing voice. Most people sound nothing like themselves when they sing, but Kweller’s sort of laid-back, eternally youthful, stoner cadence is unmistakable. NPR has <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101302481">embedded a video</a> of his in-studio performance of “Fight” on its site, while “Want Her Again” and “The Ballad of Wendy Baker (Short Version)” are streaming. All of which can be found on Kweller’s latest record, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Horses-Ben-Kweller/dp/B001N2Z414">Changing Horses</a></em>, which harkens back to his Texas roots for its country-tinged themes. During the interview on <em>All Things Considered</em>, I hadn’t realized how much of a role The Lemonheads’ Evan Dando played in Kweller’s solo career. Evidently, Dando got a copy of Kweller’s self-pressed demo, called Kweller up, and asked him to go on tour. Simple as that. But, I guess, when you’re a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radish_(band)">child prodigy</a>, weird, life-changing events are not so abnormal.</p>

<p>&#8211; Were you on drugs and what were they?     <br />&#8211; Hey, how &#8217;bout those schizophrenia rumors?      <br />&#8211; Remember when you were speaking in a British accent? What was up with that?      <br />&#8211; Parazzi-baiting (per <em>Rolling Stone</em>, <em>Blender</em> and <em>The Atlantic</em>): hobby or chore?      <br />&#8211; No really, what drugs were you on when you collapsed at PURE?      <br />&#8211; Was rehab as fun as it looks like on TV?      <br />&#8211; What did you make of Jamie Lynn&#8217;s pregnancy and were you relieved to be the lesser Spears train wreck for a while?</p>

<p>Chuck Klosterman <a href="http://www.spin.com/reviews/guns-n-roses-chinese-democracy-interscope">famously reviewed</a> <em>Chinese Democracy</em> for Spin as an April Fools joke that worked because the album has become such a mythical clusterfuck that nobody actually thought it would ever be released. Least of all <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/10/dr_pepper_announces_lame_detai.html">Dr. Pepper</a>. Now that Axl has proven everyone wrong, does he get the last laugh? Surely not. The jokes at his expense are bloated beyond Spinal Tap-ian proportions and will continue to be so, even if <em>Chinese Democracy</em> has a few passable songs. Klosterman&#8217;s <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/feature/chuck_klosterman_reviews?utm_source=avclub_rss_daily">real review</a> is up at The Onion&#8217;s A.V. Club, and it&#8217;s even more golden than his joke review:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sometimes it seems like Axl believes every single Guns N&#8217; Roses song needs to employ every single thing that Guns N&#8217; Roses has the capacity to doâ€”there needs to be a soft part, a hard part, a falsetto stretch, some piano plinking, some R&#038;B bullshit, a little Judas Priest, subhuman sound effects, a few Robert Plant yowls, dolphin squeaks, wind, overt sentimentality, and a caustic modernization of the blues. When he&#8217;s able to temporarily balance those qualities (which happens on the title track and on &#8220;I.R.S.,&#8221; the album&#8217;s two strongest rock cuts), it&#8217;s sprawling and entertaining and profoundly impressive. The soaring vocals crush everything. But sometimes Chinese Democracy suffers from the same inescapable problem that paralyzed proto-epics like &#8220;Estranged&#8221; and &#8220;November Rain&#8221;: It&#8217;s as if Axl is desperately trying to get some unmakeable dream song from inside his skull onto the CD, and the result is an overstuffed maelstrom that makes all the punk dolts scoff. His ambition is noble, yet wildly unrealistic.&#8221;  </p></blockquote>

<p>Slate has employed Sleater-Kinney&#8217;s Carrie Brownstein to test it out and review music video games <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2177432/">before</a>. This <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2204766/pagenum/2">time</a> it&#8217;s for Wii Music. The piece is cleverly titled &#8220;Wii Will Rock You.&#8221;</p>
<p>An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>The game shows you a fantastical sonic world but falls short of letting you invent your own. Instead, one&#8217;s enjoyment of Wii Music must exist in the mock creation, in the augmenting of your own imagination. Wii Music elevates the scope of music video games by moving beyond commentary on what music isâ€”as Rock Band and Guitar Hero doâ€”to suggesting what it could be. Yet I&#8217;m still left wondering: Couldn&#8217;t it be more?</p></blockquote>
