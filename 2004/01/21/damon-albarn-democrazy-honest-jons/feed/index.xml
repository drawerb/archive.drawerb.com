					<description><![CDATA[Has it struck you that this isn&#039;t a conventional solo record? The solo record was originally planned to be The Good, The Bad And The Queen.

Quite frankly, I doubt you&#039;ve ever met the bloke, and if that&#039;s the way you judge people by what you observe, then Mr. Albarn is spot on about celebrity culture.

I bet you feel pretty stupid now that Blur have returned for a one-off tour, Gorillaz have exploded and Albarn&#039;s had success with the aforementioned The Good, The Bad And The Queen and Monkey but to name a couple. I hear he&#039;s also composing the music to London 2012.

So you see, Damon Albarn IS still cool.]]></description>
