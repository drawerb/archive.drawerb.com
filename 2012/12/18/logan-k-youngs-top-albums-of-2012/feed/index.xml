					<description><![CDATA[@bdm, typically, I just google stuff from Logan&#039;s lists. I find that process kind of fun. (Exploring, researching, listening, etc). Like flipping through a bin at a record store. I can see your point, though, but I don&#039;t actually think a description or justification from Logan would change things for me as a reader. I&#039;m still working on my list. Perhaps I&#039;ll include my reasons for my selections this year. :)

Thanks for the feedback!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Understood. I always leave commentary on mine, but this is partly my site. I&#039;m lucky to get some of the other contributors&#039; input at all, so I can only ask for so much from them. Thanks for the input.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Two things:

1 - I find it incredibly unhelpful for reviewers to give top 10 lists that are essentially laundry lists of the year in music.  It would be much more useful to your readers if you could give a short (1-2 sentences minimum) describing why you liked a particular album/song/show.   You clearly are exposed to more music throughout the year than I am, so use that exposure as an opportunity to tell me and others not only what you liked over the past year, but why.  As a long-time reader of drawerb, I find myself thinking this same thing on a yearly basis.

2 - Thanks for the link to the old reviews and comments.  The &quot;I really hate you...&quot; comment is genius.  I was laughing pretty hard, especially at the last line.]]></description>
