					<description><![CDATA[I think that the above review accurately describes the recording.  I should know, since I was the crappy singer and guitar player.  I guess you just had to be there at the time to understand how such a thing could be made.  I myself was  18 and full of enthusiasm, but lacking in life experience.   At the time, seven people were living in a two-bedroom house in between a bank and a taco bell.  After 5 visits by the police, the house got raided and we all narrowly avoided jail.  Aaron, the brains behind the operation, who by the way didn&#039;t live there, had created most of the tracks before the group became a trio.  Who gives a fuck, right? Well, there is so much that went on behind the scenes.  I readily agree that for the most part el sexy sucks major balls.  We did go on to make better stuff.  This was recorded in an attic that was 110 degrees with the keyboard sitting on an old toilet with a deer bone chandelier hanging above it by a bunch  of greenhorns...By the way, you&#039;d shit if you heard what we&#039;re doing these days...sigh.  Thanks for breakin&#039; it down.  Maybe if we had ambition and equipment we could make it...or not.  My new band is called the dang heathens.  Aaron is now in a band called stationary odyssey, and Tim is in a band called namaste.  And so the musical paths diverge.]]></description>
