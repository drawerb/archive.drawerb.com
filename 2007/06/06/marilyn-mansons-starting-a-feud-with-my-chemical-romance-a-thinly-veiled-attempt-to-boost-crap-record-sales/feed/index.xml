					<description><![CDATA[I listen to both im a bit divided here... even tho i hav been a mcr fan longer, atm marilyn manson is my favourite artist out of both. personally i think marilyn over-reacted tho! he should have instead, talked to the band themselves NICELY and pointed out the similarities - of which he would hav noticed aren&#039;t that many]]></description>
