					<description><![CDATA[That dude from mean venus aint opening for nobody. He died 6 months ago from heroin. I heard that was one of the reasons that Plant isn&#039;t doing the tour too. After this Krauss b.s. he is done. Really ashame the Zep guys can&#039;t honor Plant&#039;s decision and understand that losing your son to heroin is something that most people never emotionally come back from.

RIP J

MEAN VENUS ruled!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Who will Led Zeppelin have as an opening act on their 2008 US tour??? 
The rumors have finally been silenced: Plant has personally tapped his illegitimate son&#039;s band--MEAN VENUS--to open all 2008 shows. 
MEAN VENUS&#039; lead singer, J, when recently interviewed by Rolling Stone magazine, spoke of his utter disbelief at the prospect: 
&quot;I only found out he [Plant] was my dad a few years ago. 
My mum hid it from me for the majority of my life. So to actually be going on the road with my Dad is bloody outrageous!&quot;.....]]></description>
