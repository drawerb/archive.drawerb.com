					<description><![CDATA[Editors aint got shit on Interpol!!! That writer Mark Beaumont is without a doubt, a complete and utter cunt. Clearly not up to date with his music and doesn&#039;t deserve that job i&#039;d say.
This is like saying you love Interpol but despise Joy Division.
Interpol are definitely not a rip off of JD, but thier music definitely goes in the same catagory.
As for Editors, they might not be high-jacking interpols shit, but they are DEFINITELY NOT, IN NO WAY SHAPE OR FORM BETTER..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know that Editors can ever rival the presence and just unmistakeable cool that Interpol seem to be made of. And that translates directly into their music. Interpol are just superior. I like Editors a lot too though, no disrespect to them.]]></description>
