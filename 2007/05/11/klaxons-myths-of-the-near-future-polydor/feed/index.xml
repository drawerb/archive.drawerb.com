					<description><![CDATA[The music the Klaxons create isn&#039;t made for the best ratings (although in many cases has proved that wrong), but for the pleasure of it&#039;s followers. Obviously as a fan I&#039;m giving quite a biased view, but surely the fans are all that matter? Catchy tunes and  mind-boggling lyrics can and have sufficed in the pop world. Although it is not made to bring out the Lennon in all of us, for those of use who enjoy it, it is our way of letting off some steam. Although I have enjoyed many of the reviews here, there&#039;s a point where some things need to be taken alot less seriously.]]></description>
