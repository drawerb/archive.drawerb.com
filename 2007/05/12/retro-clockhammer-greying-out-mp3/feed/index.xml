					<description><![CDATA[Oh well , time to file a missing persons report...  Quick postscript:  A few years back I was in Tucson and I caught a live performance of former Tsunami frontwoman Jenny Toomey... Chatted with her briefly after the show &#038; even saw her &#038; her band at a bar shortly thereafter... failing to realize that her bass player was Matt Swanson; my friend pointed it out to me the next day...  A missed opportunity to shake hands with a musical hero, and of course to ask if *he* maybe knew what became of Bailey.  Oh well.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;None. I&#039;m from Nashville, and I even spoke with original drummer Ken Coomer one time about Bailey. He knew of the &#039;So Much for You&#039; version of Clockhammer, calling it something like &quot;Kansas-lite.&quot; I know that incarnation of the band played a few live dates in the US, but after that I have no idea what happened to Bailey.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description><![CDATA[Fan from the moment I stumbled across  &quot;Greying Out&quot; on a free label sampler cassette circa 1991(?), but living in a cultural vaccuum out on Long Island, New York  I never got to see them live (hell, I&#039;ve never physically run into another &#039;hammer fan)...  &#039;Klinefelter&#039; is a masterpiece.   A 45 minute Bailey-songs-only redux of &#039;So Much for You&#039; is solid, if not groundbreaking.   Over the years I have kept hoping that Byron would turn back up in a new band or as a solo act, but he seems to have vanished from the scene completely.  Any idea of what became of him?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah,

I was another Clockhammer devotee in the 80s.  They originally were a foursome, two guitars including Bailey&#039;s cousin, who went back to Virginia, I seem to remember, giving up the music.  Those early demos/concerts were some of the most ass-kicking music I have ever heard, reigning in technique and hence much less infected by the Nashville hyper-technical thing.  Two maniac guitar players with Jaguars and GREAT songs.  Whatever happened to Clockhammer, what&#039;s certain is that they were eccentric people and the fact that it fell apart seemed very natural, like all the other damaged people and bands that fell apart in Nashville back in those days.  If I could only find that tape again...devastating stuff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Clockhammer was never stale. It&#039;s diversity was way ahead of its time. I love music that dares to be different and it was. I agree with most of your glowing review, but there are many sides to a story and I&#039;m not sure if pinning the break-up on Bailey is fair. Oh yeah, he is a fabulous guitar player, you are right about that.]]></description>
