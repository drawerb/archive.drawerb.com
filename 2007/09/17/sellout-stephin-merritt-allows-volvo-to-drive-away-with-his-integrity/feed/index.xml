					<description><![CDATA[Rex, sir, you&#039;re missing the point.  A crappy band can&#039;t technically &quot;Sell Out&quot; by scoring a Car commercial. In fact that crappy band might get a ride all the way to the bank.

Only a band or in this case a musician with an impressive oeuvre and history of artistic integrity can truly Sell Out. 

And who uses the label &quot;haters&quot; in a discussion about indiepop icons?  We&#039;re talking about Stephin &quot;motherfucking&quot; Merritt, not Tupac.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Y&#039;know, it&#039;s such an easy thing to be a hater and accuse someone of being a sellout when you haven&#039;t a clue what it&#039;s like to be in their shoes.  There is no doubt that most of you haters would be peeing all over yourself if your crappy band was asked to be in a car commercial.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[true, true. but isn&#039;t hanging yourself - no matter your situation - grounds for a wag of the finger? yeah, life&#039;s tough. and most of the time it&#039;s a real bitch. but both he and cobain had kids and families. i&#039;m not one to try and delve into another man&#039;s heart (or anus) and try to divine some sort of reason for why he killed himself. it was by far the best career move either party could have ever made - no doubt. the headlines virtually write themselves: &quot;Torn Apart By Love, Singer Watches Herzog and Strangles Himself&quot; or &quot;The Guy Who Wrote &#039;I Hate Myself and I Want To Die&#039; Finally Blew His Brains Out.&quot; suicide - while it makes all kinds of existential sense i suppose - is at least grounds for some sort of disapproval. shit, if it didn&#039;t, i would&#039;ve done it long ago prolly. but then again, you kill yourself, you gay.]]></description>
