					<description><![CDATA[well I bought the damn thing and I am confused about it.  The small sticker on the box states that it contains 180g vinyl (True) and the Original Album Art (Totally False).  My copies are like this. One album is white; one is black and one is grey.  They album covers DO NOT HAVE ANY ARTWORK.  They are totally blank and so are the labels on the discs.  There is a one-sheet inside. Gold letters on jet black that lists the album tracks. and it says the box is &quot;Edition of 3000&quot; . it doesn&#039;t tell you which number you have.  Why are these blank? the individual LPs replicate the artwork . they were not advertised as Blank.  I e-mailed Rhino about this.

					<description><![CDATA[Good to hear I&#039;m not the only one who thinks this is ridiculous.

Below  is an email I sent off to Rhino a couple days ago and still have gotten no response.


Hello,

 Having been a long time fan and collector of Factory records and Joy Division I was eagerly awaiting your Joy Division re-issues.

Imagine my surprise when I saw a box set of the vinyl. Sure I already own about six or seven copies of each album from different countries etc.  But how about buying a nice box of 180gm pressed, freshly remastered editions. Sounds goodâ€¦well actually it didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t once I looked at the price.

Is there anything inside the Joy Division/Peter Saville box besides the three (four total) records? A book maybe?

It seems a bit excessive that the box alone is $115. Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />m sure you must have left this detail out. Surely there is a hardcover book annotating the recording sessions or something?

Odd that individually you could buy all three albums for $85.94 but with a box itâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s $115 more.

I understand limited editions and Rhino Handmade and such but isnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t this just outright gauging?

I bought an original reproduction of Peter Savilleâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s Fact 1 poster from Peter Saville a few years back. That wasnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t even as much and there were only 100 of those.

Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />m totally disappointed in Rhino. Having been in the music business for over twenty years, and growing up with Rhino. Consistently youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ve put out the greatest collections, done the best work on reissues (the Echo and the Bunnymen CDâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s sounded amazing!) but this appears to be a new low in the music business. Hopefully Iâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />ll still â€œGo to Rhino Recordsâ€ but my faith has diminished.]]></description>
