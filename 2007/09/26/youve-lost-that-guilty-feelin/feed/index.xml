					<description><![CDATA[yeah, i know. but i kinda like &quot;let it be.&quot; in fact, the title track was what got me into them in the first place. (although i very distinctly remember hearing lionel richie doing it first and asking my mother why all his songs aren&#039;t that good.) the whole order thing really gets out of hand if you start considering releases here and in the U.K. stateside, &quot;the white album&quot; was followed by my fav - &quot;magical mystery tour.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Point of order (literally): &lt;i&gt;Let it Be&lt;/i&gt; might&#039;ve been The Beatles&#039; last release, but it was recorded before &lt;i&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/i&gt;.
