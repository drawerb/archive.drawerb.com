					<description><![CDATA[i awoke from my nap today to catch the tail end of that show that used to be on vh1 (now vh1 classic, of course) w/ aamer halem [sic?] - &quot;bands reunited.&quot; this was the information society episode. long story short, it didn&#039;t happen...kurt harland didn&#039;t even show up. sometimes reunions don&#039;t happen. i&#039;d like to hear more stories like that. everyone else looked so sad and hurt. it was awesome! turns out InSoc does have a new disc out though:
