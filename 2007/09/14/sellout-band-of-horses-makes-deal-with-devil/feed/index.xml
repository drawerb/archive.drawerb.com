					<description><![CDATA[As a band thats trying to even get started i can understand.  if walmart said i&#039;d sponser you, id say fuck ya.  lets be mature about this, its not like they are an anti goverment  punk band.  they just a band in the 21st century trying to make a buck.  bands have to give up all the time because the capital isnt there. they can no longer make songs and play music because no one buys cds anymore.  i agree with sam, why does it matter where they sell there shit. if the country isnt grown up enough to stop stealing music then i guess we can be a little understanding, atleast.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is pretty deep stuff. Well, being from the UK, no one i know has heard of Band of Horses. Personally, i think they&#039;re the best band i&#039;ve ever heard and as for selling out, i&#039;d love to go buy some of their merchandise from anyone who sells it as i&#039;m not pretentious enough to care where it came from. The most pleasure i would get from it would be when someone asks me &quot;Who are they....Band of Horses????&quot;, then i could say, they are a great band with great music, so why not look it up? If they do, the band has benefitted from me buying their stuff and i&#039;ve benefitted by introducing this awesome band to someone else, who will hopefully do the same. Who gives a shit where its from. I like them, so there.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. time out.

broseph might have a point about leaving the gay-rage, but selling merch isn&#039;t the same as &quot;selling out.&quot; the idea of &quot;artistic purity&quot; isn&#039;t soiled because your band sells T-shirts. every band sells merch; not every band sells out. to wit: selling merch often prevents bands from having to sell out. how do you think stretch made it through all those tours? chris mclane wasn&#039;t shilling for pepsi, i can guarantee you that.
remember: keynes didn&#039;t have much of a music scene to dissect in his days.

i agree with eric: there is no &quot;theoretical&quot; selling out. you do or you don&#039;t. if you want to define selling out as selling a T-shirt on tour, be my guest, but i think that&#039;s a little extreme. that said, i think we almost have to take signing on a major off the sell-out short-list. at least there, wilco&#039;s flimsy argument of &quot;oh, well, we just wanted more people to hear our songs&quot; makes a lick of sense. can we fault a band such as modest mouse â€” who, let&#039;s face it, would be making shitty records today even if they were still on K or Up! â€” wanted to bring their music to a larger audience? and they didn&#039;t even have to do a car commercial to do it.

(yes, i know that modest mouse&#039;s &quot;gravity rides everything&quot; was used in a mazda minivan commerical. yes, that makes them sellouts. no, that doesn&#039;t make that argument any less valid.)

also, jesus totally wasn&#039;t a sell out. remember that time he spent forty days and nights fasting in the desert, and the devil came and said, &quot;dude, i&#039;ll totally give you this almond joy if you&#039;ll do a commercial with for apple?&quot; and then jesus said, &quot;no way, dude. selling out&#039;s for lame-o&#039;s?&quot; and then he came back and had a totally bitchin&#039; feast with his bros? yeah, that&#039;s totally in the bible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;your misguided and ill-informed &quot;pity&quot; doesn&#039;t change the facts. i&#039;m not sure what school of thought you were raised on, but, come on, man, wilco? seriously? anyone with an ounce of credibility - or taste for that matter - would choose the buzzcocks in a heartbeat over the likes of banalities like wilco, even though comparing the two is as ridiculous as comparing  kabbalah water to donkeys (and a dead-end, subjective debate). and without getting into the semantics of  &quot;Keynesian fiscalities&quot;, the act of &quot;selling out&quot; is just commonly accepted as 1. signing to a major label and/or 2. shilling for corporate whores, i.e. selling your music to corporate advertising. it&#039;s as simple as that. we have to agree as to what the variables mean or this discussion is pointless (which it probably is anyway). i am completely aware that turning a profit for music could technically be considered selling out, but that&#039;s not what i mean, or what the general consensus means, when using the term. so wildly off-base and unjustifiably pedantic lessons (cleverly cloaked in colorful yet ultimately digressing metaphors) on the matter from you are utterly moot. no need to bring jesus into it, either. although, i do agree in theory with your older brother about the garage. that&#039;s just not realistic or how it works. if you want to defend sucking corporate dick, you&#039;re welcome to, but you have to call it what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
