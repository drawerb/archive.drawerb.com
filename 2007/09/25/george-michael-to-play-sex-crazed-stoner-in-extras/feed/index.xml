					<description><![CDATA[&quot;If you didnâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />t know all along that George Michael was gay, youâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />re gay.&quot; Classic.

Really, how was it not obvious to everyone? I mean, just look at the lyrics to &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.&quot; Case in point:

&lt;i&gt;Wake me up before you go go / And take me dancing tonight.&lt;/i&gt;

Notice the phrase structure: &quot;Take &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt; dancing tonight.&quot; Now, not being of the dance scene, this reads as if Georgie Porgie is looking for a sugar daddy to take him to the club, after which he will reward his newfound benefactor with, as you said, &#039;ric, &quot;brown starfish explorations.&quot; So not only is Georgie Boy a nonce, he&#039;s a bottom as well.

And that we just can&#039;t abide.]]></description>
