					<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Billboard &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003637012&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;says &lt;/a&gt; there&#039;s a press conference scheduled for next week that should &quot;clear everything up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also allude to Led Zeppelin&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://ledzeppelin.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; where the date 11.13.2007 is posted. Maybe they&#039;re excited about the new Wu joint.&lt;/p&gt;
