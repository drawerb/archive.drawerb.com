					<description><![CDATA[Oh, get over yourselves.   Music ain&#039;t football - musicians can actually  improve over time.  Robert sounds fantastic, much better than the caterwauling days,  if not so instantly overwhelming -  which was always something only a naive young man could do, anyway.

Jones was and remains brilliant.  Page is one of the best guitar players of all time;  gosh, do you really think he&#039;s forgotten how? 
 
Bonzo&#039;s son is playing with them.  Can&#039;t think of a better tribute to John than these three wonderful musicians getting together with his son.  27 years is a devout enough moment of silence in my book.

And,  it&#039;s Led Zeppelin if Jimmy Page says it is.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i saw dylan in 05.  it was terrible.  i wish i could erase the image of an old, wrinkled bob dylan using a keyboard + stand as a walker.  the man didnt even pick up a guitar once.  talking about judas.  geez.  to make matters worse, all the songs were played at faster tempos than their recordings.  i know artists sometimes change things up a bit for a live show, but dylan isnt exactly known for singing clearly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Though I&#039;m inclined to agree out of concern for the legacy of the greatest band in rock history,  I think that the surviving members of Zep are such gifted musicians and  have remained sharp enough over the years, so that it may be a pretty good show. I completely and utterly agree that without John Bonham it should never be called Led Zeppelin, simply because it isn&#039;t. The other three clearly understand this based on their classy, graceful, wise,  and nearly instantaneous decision to voluntarily bring down the curtain on the biggest entertainment attraction in the world, and the finest rock band that has ever existed, the mighty Led Zeppelin.]]></description>
