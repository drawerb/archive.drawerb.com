					<description><![CDATA[did you at least make it to the vocals?  that&#039;s where it crashes and burns.  the song probably should not be covered for at least 30 years.  you automatically sound like a joke if you try it now.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i didn&#039;t get through minute one. still, it&#039;s not the worst cover i&#039;ve ever heard; i had the unfortunate pleasure of seeing several shitty high school bands attempt that song and fail miserably.

&quot;smells like teen spirit&quot; can&#039;t be that hard to cover, is it? or does every cover suffer from the song&#039;s ubiquitous and wholly unique place in the musical landscape? after all, wasn&#039;t this song the &quot;anarchy in the uk&quot; for the grunge generation?]]></description>
