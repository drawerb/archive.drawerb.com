					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s the revolving door syndrome that occurs with celebrities and rehab.   The dialogue at the start is sadly, probably very accurate considering the subjects.   I think it&#039;s quite effective.  The black and white coloring is beautiful and I dig the string music at the start and finish.  I&#039;m not a Duran Duran fan in general, but this video drew my attention to the song.   Thank god it&#039;s not another Girls on Film video, one 80&#039;s coke fest was enough.   At least this is somewhat relevant to today.]]></description>
