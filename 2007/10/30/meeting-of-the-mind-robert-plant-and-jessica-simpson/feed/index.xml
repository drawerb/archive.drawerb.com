					<description><![CDATA[Two blondes walk into a bar; one is a dingy media sensation and the other is one of the biggest music icons of all time...  &quot;Look at this.&quot; says one to the other.  You can now use your imagination to decide who said what.  It&#039;ll be great to see what everyone else thinks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[That was cruel to say about Jessica.  When you say hurtful things.. there are people out there with feelings.  Think before you swing axes. 

Robert Plant is most likely a very wonderful and kind person.  He&#039;s probably looking at her and thinking how beautiful she is. Atleast that&#039;s what I&#039;d like to think.  Be kind. Life is short.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Um, not that I generally defend any bubble-gum pop star but her tits are real.  That I can defend without any guilt...they&#039;re nice.

I love Zep.  I think Rober Plant is imagining bending her over an amp and giving her the real rock star treatment.]]></description>
