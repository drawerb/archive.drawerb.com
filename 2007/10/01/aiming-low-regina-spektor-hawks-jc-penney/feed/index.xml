					<description><![CDATA[Kudos to E!  Who cares really? But, I think Snowmaster has more of a point, than patrick.  (The whole &quot;get bent&quot; thing is unnecessary, really, folks.)  The moment an artist takes a dime for their talents, they have in effect, sold out.  From their first time on stage for pay to doing a Penney&#039;s commercial (in this case) no matter how much they profit, they are trading on their talent.  What is wrong with that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Honestly, do any of you know Regina Spektor personally or, for a fact know how much money that she made from the ad? The answer I am sure is no. Anyway, you all need to get over yourselves and stop with the accusations!! Stop being obsessed with what people in the &quot;lime light&quot; do and start being concerned with how you live your own pathetic lives. By the way when I say pathetic it is true by the fact that you revolve your lives around what other people do. Mind your own business. Regina Spektor is talented and whether or not she did an add for JcPenny&#039;s is not going to change that. You either like her or  you don&#039;t like her, leave it at that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[SnowMaster, get bent. She&#039;ll barely see a dime from JC Penny, and no more than she&#039;d see from any other royalty venues. I&#039;d prefer that artists keep their integrity and not feel as if they have to sing for their supper.

Come up here to the high ground; you can see everything from up here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so perplexed by the &quot;nobody pays for music&quot; justification for selling your music to corporate america so you &quot;can eat.&quot;

Believe it or not, most major label acts saw very little revenue from record sales, even before MP3 killed the Record Stores.  It&#039;s not like people have stopped going to concerts, which is where most acts have always made their moolah.

And I doubt anyone is getting rich off of selling their music to WalMart, Target, Volvo, JCPenny&#039;s or even Friendly&#039;s.]]></description>
