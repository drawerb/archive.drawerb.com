					<description><![CDATA[I find this a little freaky &quot;Second, his influences and affinities are instantly obvious: Stephin Merritt&#039;s drone, Morrissey&#039;s bite, Belle and Sebastian&#039;s atmospherics, with some of Jonathan Richman&#039;s wild pitch and yaw. &quot; compared with my review in January of 2005 &quot;Your Merritt-like vocals, your Knox worthy lyrical musings, your tinny Glaswegianesque symphonies, your Butterfly Child-like orchestrations and last but not least your lovable Richman inflections.&quot;

Any way you put it, he is definitely a pop genius.  I can&#039;t wait to see him on Thursday!]]></description>
