					<description><![CDATA[i hated zeppelin as a matter of course growing up because every redneck fruitcake confederate flag waving asshole loved them. so, i went out of my way to distance myself from that scene, even though in the back of my mind i didn&#039;t dislike the music as much as i disliked the people who did like it. so, sure, i was slightly older when i started listening to them and admitting it. i think they&#039;re easily one of the top three greatest bands of all time. and even those whose tastes swerve away from some of the band&#039;s histrionics, save for wonderfully absurd ranters like logan, will acknowledge the band&#039;s extraordinary individual talents.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Look, there was a time when Zep needed to be dissed on. (See: Live Aid, 1985.)

As an elitist music snob who&#039;d never be confused with a hipster â€” they won&#039;t even let me in the cool hipster bars to use the shitter any more â€” I can honestly say that I&#039;ve never truly dug Zeppelin. It wasn&#039;t because it was &quot;fashionable&quot; or &quot;cool&quot; to hate on Zeppelin. Hell, I got beaten up in middle school because I didn&#039;t like &quot;Stairway.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Zep I&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;II&lt;/i&gt; are classic albums, to be sure, and the players are all top-notch, but I&#039;ll take The Who over Zeppelin just about any day.

Now, if you&#039;ll excuse me, I&#039;m going to go listen to some metal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re: &quot;the Danes&quot; - Hamlet I presume? - there truly is &quot;something rotten in the state of Denmark.&quot; And yee smells like yet another needless, money-grubbing reunion of a band that, for my money anyways, was always overrated both in terms of the actual music they produced and the legacy we&#039;ve since ascribed to them henceforth...both elistist hipster snobs and rockist revivalists alike. Write a fucking song for Chrissakes, not endless and mindless riffs any 2-bit hack w/ a Rogue electric guitar, First Act amp and some knock-off distortion pedal could&#039;ve mastered back when K there was in middle school. What little respect I ever had for them was flushed down the toilet - in through the out door, wholesale - when Paige and P. Diddy (or whatever that self-aggrandizing butt munch goes by these days) got together on SNL. As for Maitre Plant, keep on trying to get in Jessica Simpson&#039;s pants - you might have to fight off her father&#039;s schlong though - &#039;cause I&#039;ve long since cared about anything you&#039;ve to say. Nice goatee though!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;My point is that hipster music snobs have finally come around. &quot;  Was there a time when Music Snobs disliked Zep?  I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever met a music snob that dissed on Led Zeppelin.  Seriously.  I know a lot of music snobs.  It would be pretty hard to make a case against Led Zeppelin.  Same goes for Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood Mac, etc.  They might be guilty pleasures, but they&#039;re certainly not getting the high hat from anyone that truly appreciates music.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hilarious.  Hipsters are now being chided for liking an old band.  Ye Hipsters can&#039;t win!  I went through my Zep phase for a few months in Junior High and High School and while I appreciate what they did for Rock, I haven&#039;t really had any significant need for them since, even given their increased press coverage.  So, don&#039;t go generalizing.  Trust me, not all music snobs are re-living their days of getting the Led out.]]></description>
