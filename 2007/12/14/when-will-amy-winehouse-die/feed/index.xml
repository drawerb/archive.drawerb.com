					<description><![CDATA[I put my guess in, and maybe I&#039;ll get the iPod.  But really I could give less than a shit about her well being.  I&#039;m sick to death about  hearing how celebs can pump themselves full of drugs and booze, cause damage to public and private property, break the law, harm other prople and still get a slap on the wrist.  So, basically, Pete Doherty can drive on drugs and inject heroin into unconcious fans...what do you think would happen to a black man in the US if he did the same thing?  he&#039;d better be rich or famous, cause he&#039;d be facing a healthy sentence.  Same for Winehouse, how does she get away with trashing a hotel room without spending a night in cells?  Good riddance.]]></description>
