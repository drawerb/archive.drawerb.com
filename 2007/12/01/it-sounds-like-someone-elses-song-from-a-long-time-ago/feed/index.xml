					<description><![CDATA[I stumbled onto this blog because I&#039;ve been searching for a song.  I think it was from the 80&#039;s and that it was in Fast Times (but not on the soundtrack).

Anyways, the riff from this song sounds a lot like the riff from QotSA&#039;s No One Knows.  Only a little faster.

Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The base line and drums in Jet&#039;s &quot;Are you gonna be my girl&quot; are similar to &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, which in this respect is also similar to &quot;You can&#039;t hurry love&quot;.

But the prominent guitar riff in &quot;Are you gonna be my girl&quot; is almost 1:1 the same as in the White Stripes&#039; &quot;Screwdriver&quot; on their 2001 self-titled album.  Since the Jet album is from 2003, you could call it a rip-off, I guess. But then again the two riffs may have been invented independently from each other, who knows.

But anyway, if the list is only about guitar riffs in the 21st century, it should feature the earlier (but admittedly rather unknown) &quot;Screwdriver&quot; instead of Jet&#039;s hit single, just to be fair.]]></description>
