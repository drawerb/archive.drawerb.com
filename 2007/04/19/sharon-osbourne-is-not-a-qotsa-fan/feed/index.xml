					<description><![CDATA[obviously a cry for attention there, Sharon. If you can&#039;t handle someone&#039;s honesty then *of course* there&#039;s only one way to get your point across: &quot;ME ANGRY! ME WANT DEAD!&quot; like some fuckin&#039; caveman...sarcasm noted there. Take it like a *civilized* being; there&#039;s a damn good reason Homme said what he did, and it&#039;s probably true considering he&#039;s not wishing anyone&#039;s dick to fall off. But hey, what&#039;s a non-celeb peon like me know? *chuckle* and personally i&#039;d like Homme to live eternally. Like a vampire, but beyond better.]]></description>
