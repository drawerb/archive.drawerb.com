					<description><![CDATA[To say that the last Cure record was in 1989 (perhaps pertaining to &#039;Disintegration&#039;) is of course, subjective. As a listener of The Cure since the early &#039;80s, I compared every album with each other. Of course, there&#039;s always the common denominator, and every album produces great songs, though ignored because of the quick turn up of albums and artists nowadays. Wish, Wild Mood, The Cure each has its share of great Cure moments. Like &quot;High,&quot; &quot;Round and Round,&quot; &quot;Maybe Someday,&quot; and &quot;Taking Off.&quot;]]></description>
