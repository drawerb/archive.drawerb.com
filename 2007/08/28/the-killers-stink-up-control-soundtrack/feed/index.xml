					<description><![CDATA[what a horrible cover.
There are songs you can cover in your own way, but then there are songs you just don&#039;t change.  Shadowplay is one of them,]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yo.As a hardcore Joy Division fan who was around back then I love the Killers version, and I&#039;m not a huge fan of theirs but I think they have some good tracks. The best thing about the cover is that it is not full reverence and just goes for an un selfconscious kick off. I like alot, amybe lots of bands could have done it better , muse, interpol, radiohead....but they did&#039;nt.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Wah, Wah, it&#039;s the Killers, Oh no, they covered a song of a band who I love, Wah I tell you, Wah! I built up a high wall around me and if some other band (The Killers for you in this case) tries to climb up this wall and I actually see them, I CRY, WAH!&quot;

ROFL, get real.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I just picked up a copy of the CONTROL soundtrack and the Killers version of Shadowplay is SO GOOD! It comes right after &quot;What Goes On&quot; by Velvet Underground and an audio clip from the (highly recommended) movie and works perfectly. This is seriously a next level cover.....At the very least, give it a listen and see for yourself before you hate on it just because of who plays it........]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[you guys sound like people who hate whatever is popular. the killers sold millions of records so you hate them. you sound like u haven&#039;t even heard the song, like u hate the song just Because it&#039;s the killers.

don&#039;t let your politics cloud your ability to be open-minded. &quot;oh, this is a bid for commercial audiences&quot;.  ok.  so what? what does that have to do with the Actual Song?

Now does the song really suck, or do u just hate it because they are pop? i bet u sit around talking about awesome Bloc  Party is, but next year you&#039;ll be hating them because they finally got a mainstream following.

Or maybe the killers just suck. i don&#039;t know. i&#039;m gonna go steal this song from somewhere and find out.]]></description>
