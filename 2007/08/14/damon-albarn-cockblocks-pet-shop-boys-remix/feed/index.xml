					<description><![CDATA[Right - that grudge bit sounds like XFM speculating purely to make the story more interesting. 

Can&#039;t say I blame Damon - He&#039;s a hero, though I know he&#039;s a bit of a dick every now and again. But if he not into what PSB have done with his music, why should he agree? He could have just shut up and picked up the paycheck (though I&#039;m sure he&#039;s not hurting with all that Gorillaz dough).]]></description>
