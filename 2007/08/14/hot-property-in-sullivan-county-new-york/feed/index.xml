					<description><![CDATA[The &#039;official&#039; 25th anniversary show was held in Saugerties, NY on a site around eight miles from the Woodstock village green. It&#039;s where I went to high school (though I&#039;d graduated by then). If I&#039;m not mistaken, there was some kind of event at Yasgur&#039;s farm in 1994, though it sounded like it was a roster mostly made up of people who didn&#039;t get asked to play in Saugerties, like Country Joe (with or without the Fish).]]></description>
