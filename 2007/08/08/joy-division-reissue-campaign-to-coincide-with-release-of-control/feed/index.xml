					<description><![CDATA[the only reason to release something that&#039;s already there - and brilliant at that - is for the extras. if we find warsaw&#039;s cover of &quot;that&#039;s alright (mama)&quot; then we should probably release that. otherwise, it amounts to exactly what kerry said 8 comments ago - &quot;sad and embarrassing.&quot; hopefully, &quot;control&quot; will spur some confused, depressed, pock-mocked 15-year-old to go out and buy &quot;unknown pleasures&quot;...just as an ex-girlfriend&#039;s break-up mix tape inspired me to do the same. if i believed in god, i would just pray that &quot;Yogan Loung&quot; doesn&#039;t find it in a new, deluxe, director&#039;s cut, commentary by joe levy, re-issue at target.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know exactly what I&#039;m arguing.  I think I just find the flogging sad.  I love JD, I just think re-re-re-re-releasing their records and more live discs, etc. dilutes things and comes across as a desperate attempt to continue to cash in on Ian.

Anyone unfamiliar with Joy Division who sees Control and wants to hear more JD should have no trouble tracking down a copy of  Closer, Still, Permanent, Unknown Pleasures, Heart&amp;Soul, Preston, et al., without requiring re-releases and more live records.]]></description>

 i think it&#039;s the re-to-the-fourth-power releasing of all of the catalog - both studio proper and otherwise - that&#039;s the ethical dilemma. and yet, if more people are turned on to them that&#039;s fucking great.]]></description>
