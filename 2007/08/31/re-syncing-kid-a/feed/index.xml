					<description><![CDATA[&quot;play two copies of Radiohead’s Kid A seventeen seconds apart&quot;

you dont play 2 copies ot radiohead kid a, 17 seconsd apart, that would make the second song start while the last 17 seconds of the first one is playing as some example.
So the first second of the second song would only start to play when second song is at 17 second mark, on third song it would just start to play when the song is on 34 mark, and this woulcd go increasing to each song (17 * [song number you are on minus 1])
You just play 2 copies of some song of kid a 17 secons apart.]]></description>
