					<description><![CDATA[*rolls eyes*
ok, so thier cover isn&#039;t that great. But doesn&#039;t this show that they have a whole lot of admiration for Joy Division to do a cover. A whole lot of bands look up to Joy Division and what they did. Get over it. Seriously. This doesn&#039;t make them any less musicians. And come on! A bunch of kids today wouldn&#039;t know who Joy Division is if it weren&#039;t for bands doing covers. The fan base has grown because of things like this.]]></description>
