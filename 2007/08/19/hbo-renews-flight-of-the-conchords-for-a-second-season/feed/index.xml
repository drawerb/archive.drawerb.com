					<description><![CDATA[I love Flight of the Conchords. It is brilliant and I&#039;m surprised (and delighted) that it&#039;s being watched by so many people.  It is very clever and the humor is sly and subtle. Love the musical references.  

I&#039;d have to say that the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; episode is my absolute favorite. I have the DVD of the first season and I&#039;ve watched that episode about six times already.

I also think the obsessed, creepy stalker character of Mel is just fantastic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Flight of the Conchords is a hilarious show and I&#039;m thrilled that it will return for a second season, but I am also disappointed that we&#039;ll have to wait until January &#039;09 (or later, for those of us that don&#039;t have HBO) to watch it. I realize that they need time to tour and write new material, but the wait is agonizing, and my frustration is compounded by the improbability that they will visit a city near my podunk town on their tour this year. 
Luckily, I have a cryogenic stasis preservation chamber to cram myself into. Wake me when it&#039;s January, or when there is a cure for my mental illness- whichever comes first (January).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m honestly amazed that it&#039;s being watched by so many people. The humor is so niche and the references are so subtle that I have a hard time imagining a big audience getting behind it, especially when masses of brain-dead neanderthals are glued to dreck like Two and a Half Men. But I&#039;m definitely excited to see it do well.]]></description>
