					<description><![CDATA[The new VH lineup sucks anyway. Eddie is half the guitarist he used to be and Roth is a washed up has been. Gotta love Sammy, He just starts his own thing with Mike and Chad Smith and then brings in the best guitarist in music to finish the lineup. Chickenfoot is a WAAAAY better band. If DLR would ever shut his mouth long enough to actually sing, Eddie would get over himself and Woofie would learn to play they might be ok again someday.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The fact that VH didn&#039;t hit the road following a new album says a lot about this version.  Not to mention they didn&#039;t immediately follow up with an album either says we have nothing new to offer.  Just being talented musicians doesn&#039;t make talented song writers.  Aerosmith has proven both abilities while Van Halen hit a snag after Hagar leaving.  Cherone never should have been a frontman for this band.  Taking so long for the return of David Lee Roth hurt VH&#039;s image.  Sammy Hagar has been successfully writing hits since Montrose and with bands long before that.  I say for VH to gain credibility it will need to put out a cutting edge record followed by an equally great live performance tour.]]></description>
