					<description><![CDATA[FYI...
Re: Notorious

&quot;With material from three guitarists, the band has since found it difficult to tell what guitarist ended up playing on what finished track.&quot;

It&#039;s quite possible Andy wrote the aforementioned Skin Trade and Notorious but was never credited. Perhaps we&#039;ll never know.

					<description><![CDATA[They were two SEPARATE thoughts. I wasn&#039;t crediting him with them.

I saw Andy perform these songs live and he played every chord as if he had written them. Perhaps he&#039;s a loose cannon but I give him credit for performing 110% -- even songs that weren&#039;t &quot;his.&quot;

					<description><![CDATA[Andy did the right thing in ditching DD after the new record changed direction. Timbaland? JT? Are you kidding. Does every song Timba produce have to have a haunting human yelp in it?

JT had way too much influence over the record. He literally said to DD, &quot;where is the next Ordinary World?&quot; Well, this record doesn&#039;t have it. Even Astronaut had more OW-like potential hits -- &quot;Nice&quot;...&quot;Tomorrow&quot; ... &quot;Sunrise&quot; Maybe these tunes are sugar-coated but at least they have some creativity. Falling Down? Dull and redundant.

Without Andy, DD loses all its cred. The Ordinary World hook. It doesn&#039;t get better than that. Skin Trade? A gem. Notorious. A funk classic.

RCM may be club ready, but DD has lost its magic thanks to interference from two guys who know a little bit about programming drum beats.
