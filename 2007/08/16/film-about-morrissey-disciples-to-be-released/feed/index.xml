					<description><![CDATA[I remember seeing ole Moz at an Opera house outside of LA in the mid to late &#039;90s where the crowd went absolutely batshit insane when he played a Smiths song.  Like guys crying, throwing gladiolas, passing out total Beatlemania, etc.  It was almost like what I&#039;d imagine attending a cult like event would be like.  Fast forward 10 years to when I saw Morrissey last month.  I went expecting to see the same screaming, crying crowds  as well as loads of latinos like I&#039;d always read/heard about, but the audience was primarily aging hipsters and exurb yups.  (It could have been the venue or the excessive ticket price, I suppose).    

Oddly, Morrissey played several Smiths tunes at this show to which the crowd roared their approval, but I witnessed no crying, or anything remotely obsessive.]]></description>
