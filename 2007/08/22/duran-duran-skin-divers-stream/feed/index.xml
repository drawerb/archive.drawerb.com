					<description><![CDATA[This review was prescient, since RCM was an unadulterated disaster sales-wise. Besides the sales performance, though, many of the songs were quite good. Sadly, &quot;Skin Divers&quot; isn&#039;t one of the good ones. It&#039;s Google-dirty-BAD.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Been a Durannie for almost 25 years now and at first glance I thought the new album would not rock my world. However, if you give it a few spins it grows on you. Now I absolutely love it! It may not top the first three albums, but it gets pretty close. Besides, Duran Duran have always been at the forefront of innovation, which is what they prove once again. I just hope popular radio will give them a chance to cast their new spell onto the world. Fabulous!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is easily my favorite track on the album, and one of my favorite Duran tracks ever.  And I&#039;m an old Duranie from way back... I&#039;m 43, and I can&#039;t stop listening to this song.  It rocks.  I wish I could hear this in clubs across the land. This deserves to be their biggest hit ever, and it&#039;s a shame that it doesn&#039;t appear it will be.]]></description>
