					<description><![CDATA[this song is so relaxing. i love how jj can make such amazing music and make it sound so simple. great song. this video complements the song so well. jj has come out with two great albums in such a small period of time. i just picked up their second album, jj nº3, at my local record store... incredible. i really want to pick up their first album, jj nº2, but i can&#039;t find it anywhere but on itunes... does anyone know when their first album will physically come out? i&#039;m pretty pumped to get my hands on that.]]></description>
