					<description><![CDATA[K, I&#039;m with you on Elliot Smith.  So many people over the years have been surprised when I&#039;ve said that I&#039;m not a fan of his.  

My memories of Grace are inextricably linked to WUSC.  I played the heck out of that CD on-air in late 1994, and then I wore out my own cassette tape that also had Sebadoh&#039;s Bakesale on the flipside.  The soundtrack of a few doomed romances.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I like his music OK, but I never really connected with it. My sister stole my copy of Grace and I didn&#039;t really even care.  I&#039;ve always sort of felt the same way about Elliot Smith.
