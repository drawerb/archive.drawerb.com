					<description><![CDATA[Disintegration is one of my favs but how could you say 20 yrs of &quot;rehashed rubbish&quot; proceeded.  I could listen to the Wish album from start to finish.  So the other albums are not up to par but you can still find the true essence of the cure on some of the songs.  Here are a few

Underneath the Stars from 4:13 Dream

The Promise from The Cure album

Lost from The Cure album

The Last day of Summer from Bloodflowers

Want from Wild Mood Swings

Strange Attraction from Wild Mood Swings

Bare from Wild Mood Swings]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am looking forward to hearing the previously unreleased live material from the concert which became Entreat.  However, I am disappointed that this 3 disc set is not actually a complete treatment of Disintegration.  Notably missing are the original versions of B-sides such as Out of Mind, Babble, 2 Late, and Fear of Ghosts.  The demos and outtakes are of interest, but why not include the original versions too?]]></description>
