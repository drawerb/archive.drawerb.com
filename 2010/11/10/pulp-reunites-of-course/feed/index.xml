					<description><![CDATA[I am also stranded in the South and would travel hundreds of miles by car to see them in Washington D.C, which is probably the closest they&#039;ll get to me, IF the tour crosses the big pond, which probably won&#039;t happen. -sigh- &quot;His + Hers&quot; was a revelation to me; the first UK band in about five years that managed to excite me and if not for them and Suede, I would have written off the British Isles completely in the 90s. No one could hold a candle to their songs. Cocker is a brilliant writer even on his own, but he&#039;ll never have a better band than Pulp to play his songs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’m not worried about Jarvis Cocker not being able to hit the notes. In fact, I think Pulp will sound as good if not better than it ever did.&quot; 
--
I&#039;ve listened to his radio show a couple of times and he sound like my dad. I don&#039;t think he&#039;ll be able to sing songs like Underwear quite convincingly. Don&#039;t even ask about the beard. Although he has a new Disco single featured on NME in  which he sounds terrific.
I don&#039;t really get excited about reunions, not even for the Pixies, Pearl Jam or Pavement (my God they&#039;re all P), but I kinda want this one.  Just to make up for the times I ignored them during their heydeys.]]></description>
