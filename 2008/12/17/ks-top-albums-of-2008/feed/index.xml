Fake controversy created by chiptune artists who were jealous of CC&#039;s small success. Even Pitchfork says the accusations are bullshit:

					<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m still kicking myself for missing the M83 and School of Seven Bells show in Charlotte. I might catch the former when they come back around with The Killers...maybe.  Didn&#039;t even hear &quot;Wermland&quot; though. I agree, &quot;Paper Float&quot; is totally kick-ass.]]></description>
