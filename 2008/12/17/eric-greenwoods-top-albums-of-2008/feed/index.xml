					<description><![CDATA[Thanks Eric! It is very flattering to be on this list with so many great bands; several of whom are not only fellow Brooklynites but also major influences on our music. We really appreciate everything you wrote about A O and hope to correspond in the future.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to have to give that Notwist record another listen.  I liked it but quickly forgot about it.  Perhaps I was expecting to fall in love at first listen like with Neon Goldern.

That Vivian Girls record is aces.  I wish it were twice as long.]]></description>
