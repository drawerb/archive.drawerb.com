					<description><![CDATA[I have all 3 of there albums; if anyone is looking for them, or a song they might like to have? 

Unfortunately, I never got to see them live, but I&#039;m in a band w/ their old guitarist, Mark (&quot;I Play Jupiter&quot;) &#038; got to jam once with, Derek - which was a thrill for me b/c I was/am a big fan of GP! 

Here&#039;s my bands website (DMDT) if anyone is interested in checking us out:
