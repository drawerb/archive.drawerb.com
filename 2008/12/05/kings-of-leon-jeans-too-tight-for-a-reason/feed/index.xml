					<description><![CDATA[People who scrutinize popular products, who do so for that reason alone, should not be given a voice.
You would think, someone who is aware of current events, privy to background information on Caleb Followill and living in the present, would be very aware of the equal aesthetic pressure inflicted upon both genders over the past 10 years (especially on teenagers), not to mention the over whelming popularity of skinny jeans in today&#039;s youth culture (which, notably started in 2003 when the band first appeared in main stream media wearing skinny jeans).
As for the haircut remark, you ridiculous arse of a man, how can you ridicule haircuts which have no outstanding features, no flamboyant nature of any kind, just bog standard hair do&#039;s, at least one of which I&#039;m sure would be comparable to your own. 

You sir are a critic for critique sake, you should be gagged and bound and hidden from the world in a darkened room until perhaps you can blossom into a human with genuine, valid, considered opinions, rather than just swimming against the tide in order to inflate what I imagine is already a horribly self satisfied, inverted snob of an ego.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that&#039;s definately a little unfair.  Men can suffer with issues like anorexia and your unsympathetic attitude is rather sad not only for Caleb but many other young men.  

Having, what can only be decribed from medical perspectives as, a serious illness like anorexia is far from &quot;douchey&quot;.  

People will struggle with many things throughout their lives.  This just happens to be one of the things that Caleb has dealt with.  I think he&#039;s a healthy looking man and can be a role model to young men.

And as for the &quot;skin-tight apparel, its rather sexy and jealousy will get you no where apart from nearer the green-eyed monster!!]]></description>
