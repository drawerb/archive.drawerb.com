					<description><![CDATA[Idly googling my own name to see what impact this ad had had and found you guys!

Sellout, my flabby arse! I LIKE beer! (Well, I didn&#039;t realise it was Light till after I&#039;d said yes, please to their impassioned entreaty to use my worthless ditty...). I sold another song, Not Given Lightly. to a NZ breadmaker - after checking they weren&#039;t using Monsanto grains - and it put my kids through college but refused to let Tegel Chicken use this same song for a local ad. Said no to 40 grand on that count so I&#039;ve got my fucking scruples, OK?!
Good.

It&#039;s been freaking out a few of my US mates though. In a good way! And yeah, the ad&#039;s lame but it is by Todd Haynes who made Safe, Velvet Goldmine and Superstar (not to mention I&#039;m Not There which opens over here in a coupla days) and if he can lower his fine self to Heineken ads then so can I.

Good to read you&#039;re still alive Eric, I remember that gig all too well - the rider beer was Miller Lite from memory and we paid for real stuff rather than let that shit past our lips.
And K, you wouldn&#039;t be Kim, would ya?

Cheese,
Chris]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Anonymous, it&#039;s our blog, our opinion, our prerogative in this space to decided whatever the hell we want.  I feel sorry for Chris.  He shouldn&#039;t have to sell his songs to beer conglomerates.  Times are tight, he&#039;s getting old, drawing comics for the newspaper doesn&#039;t pay the bills, whatever.  It&#039;s all just sad.  Anyhow, you&#039;ve got your own blog, so why not post on it instead of trying to get our goat.  You could post about the term &quot;sellout&quot;, for instance.  I look forward to reading your blog.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chris Knox has paid his dues and then some.  BoH, not so much.

The sad thing is I saw that commercial the other day and didn&#039;t realize it was Knox.  Though, the fact that I found myself singing along rather disturbed me and indicated that I &quot;knew&quot; the song.]]></description>
