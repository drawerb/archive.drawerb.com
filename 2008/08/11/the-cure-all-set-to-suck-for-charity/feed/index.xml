					<description><![CDATA[&quot;Does he honestly think a new generation of fat girls with bad fashion sense will suddenly fall under his spell?&quot;

It&#039;s happening already.

On other notes, boo hoo.  Yeah, new Cure doesn&#039;t touch old Cure (except for every teeny once in a while), but getting dogshit bands to cover you is a tried-and-true way to 1. make you look awesome because the crap bands never do a good job, even to their own fans (Orgy&#039;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot; cover not withstanding) and 2. when they DO do a version that takes with their fans, all the fans of the original band swoop in and go &quot;that&#039;s shit, listen to this&quot; and the kids discover music that doesn&#039;t suck.  In fact... that&#039;s the main way kids discover music that doesn&#039;t suck... hearing the shit bands they like cover good songs by good bands and later discovering the original is much better.  I know Evergreen Terrace doing &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; and Jack Off Jill doing &quot;Love Song&quot; when I was in high school wasn&#039;t a total loss for me...]]></description>
