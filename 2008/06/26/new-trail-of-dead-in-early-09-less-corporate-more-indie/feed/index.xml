					<description><![CDATA[Neil is sorely missed, no doubt, but closer inspection of source tags reveals that they had begun the decline the moment they signed to Interscope. Good album, yes, but missing the edge that made their first two albums classic. Sure, they fell off the cliff after that, but they were teetering before the ink dried on that contract. Maybe it wasn&#039;t Interscope&#039;s fault, maybe they just ran out of ideas. But I will never understand why they allowed Jason Reece to be pushed to the side. It&#039;s not like Conrad is so pretty or such a great songwriter, I don&#039;t get it.]]></description>
