					<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with you.  The Cure have been my favourite band since 1982, from the release of The Hanging Garden.  I simply despair at the last 2 albums, Bloodflowers &#038;  The Cure [which was anything but].  I&#039;ve given up on them now, as I can only feel that Mr Smith has lost any sense of direction he had before releasing the last album.  The complete dumping of the keyboards section and headlong jump in to trying to be a very bad &#039;rock&#039; band is unfathomable.

I can only assume that The Cure are being kept going to ensure the pensions of the other band members.  Maybe it&#039;s finally time to kill the aging rock dinosaur called The Cure.  Sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind.]]></description>
