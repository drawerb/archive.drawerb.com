					<description><![CDATA[I get it now - this is where the jaded wannabe-pitchfork writers who get rejected end up.  It&#039;s like the shitty-hipster-music-critic version of winding up in the gay bukkake industry!!  Rock on, oh ye of little taste!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[that last guy was a little harsh. but i see why he got so angry.

you do at least respect them as musicians. i&#039;d advise you to listen to more of their tunes, especially Quebec, and don&#039;t think of them as a joke band. seriously. weird al is a joke band....ween is a rock band. 

and, yes, all people, not just kids, should &#039;&#039;like what they like just because they like it&#039;&#039;, thats how life should be, we can like anything we want, there is no barometer for taste. 

sure,there&#039;s a few exceptions, such as &quot;good charlotte&quot;. no one should like them. i&#039;d excuse a kid for liking them.

but seriously, to call ween a juvenile band is plain piss poor journalism.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[i really hate you.

i hate the fact you exist, i hate the fact that there is an internet that ALLOWS you to post your opinions. i hate that you have ears to LISTEN TO MUSIC. i hate that you have  a brain that tells you your opinions are worth something. i hate that you have a mouth with which to speak. i hate that you have a body with which to go to concerts with, and that you waste that fucknig airspace when someone who really is in tune with the world, in tocuh with reality and life, could be standing.

i hate that you exist. seriously. i hate you. a lot. more than a lot of other things, really.

and now that im done hating on you, i want to point out exactly why you are such an asshole. you posit that when we are kids, we &quot; liked what you liked merely because you liked it.&quot;

why the hell else would you like something? oh yeah, when you grow up, you&#039;re supposed to like what Pitchfork and Drawer B tell you to like.

I HATE YOU. YOU HAVE NO TASTE. YOU ARE A PRETENTIOUS ASSHOLE. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN A GAY BLOWJOB.]]></description>

Then you obviously have never attended a Decemberists or Coldplay show. FYI.. I&#039;m listening to Belle and Sebastian at the moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m 36...and have spent a good part of my life seeing every band that crosses my path -- from Pearl Jam to Nirvana from Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan to Youssou N&#039;dour, from the Cro-Mags to Metallica and from the Grateful Dead to the Who -- and a WEEN show is more fun and musically interesting than any of them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more with this blogger. Ween is so passe. The singer has no true vocal range and their guitarist can barely play a tune (and not in tune either LOL).  Don&#039;t get me started on their fans. I feel sorry for the blogger having to sit around while they smoke pot around her with no respect for the laws of this nation. Weens&#039;s best song IMHO is She don&#039;t Use Jelly and even it&#039;s awful. I think I&#039;m going to play my new New Pornographers LP, read a David Sadaris book and contemplate on how refined my tastes are. I drive a Prius and I don&#039;t own a TV. Ween is bad. Feist.]]></description>
