					<description><![CDATA[There are a total of 9 live songs from this live show. It&#039;s an expanded Heads lineup with an extra bass player, percussion, vocals and an incredibly good performance from Adrian Belew (King Crimson) on guitar.

This is Remain In Light vintage Heads, and the good stuff gets a great working out.

All 11 tracks are on YouTube. You can even find the torrent if you want the whole show. The quality is as good as you can expect from a VHS copy of a TV show. 

This show illustrates just how good Talking Heads were, and the brilliance of the core band. Tina Weymouth looks scrumptious, and David Byrne is at his manic best.

I can&#039;t tell you how good this stuff is. Would have to rate as one of the best live shows ever, by any band.]]></description>
