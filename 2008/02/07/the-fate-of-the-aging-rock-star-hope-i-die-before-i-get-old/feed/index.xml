					<description><![CDATA[I guess the point I was trying to make is that age and artistic decline aren&#039;t always mutually exclusive. That is, the &quot;art&quot; doesn&#039;t always suffer because of the age.

I most definitely agree &quot;rock&quot; is a young man&#039;s game, but how many pop genre&#039;s aren&#039;t? 

Frankly, it&#039;s kind of sad to watch The Beastie Boys these days. And as much as I love Johnny Cash, people only gravitated toward him again because he started covering other people&#039;s songs.

People don&#039;t go to Rolling Stone&#039;s concerts because their newest record was so good. The Rolling Stones haven&#039;t made a decent record in my lifetime, yet they still sell out every damn tour.

After a certain point, your age becomes a novelty of nostalgia.

Again, there are exceptions. I know you say that blues musicians sort of gain credibility the older they get. But I hate the blues, so they don&#039;t count. 

(And, um, &#039;ric ... this is KFL)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[kevmo, if you&#039;re speaking in terms of an &quot;artist&quot; that couldn&#039;t be pinned down to just rock music, then i could see your point, but rock music is a youthful exploit just by nature of a general lack of responsibility at an age where musical experimentation coincides with a lack of life experience. so i think age is relevant. no rock star begins a career in his 50&#039;s, so that example doesn&#039;t make much sense to me. and i think rock music has an expiration date married exclusively to age. no one wants to see old dudes trying to act young.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if age is as much as factor as is years of performing, writing, etc. 

Say some artist cuts their first record when they are 59. It doesn&#039;t happen a lot, but that&#039;s not to say it won&#039;t ever or could never happen. There is a creative arc that artists have, a peak. It&#039;s inevitable. So by the example, this proverbial musician might not hit his decline until he is in his late 60s or early 70s, right?

Is it age, or is it experience? I say the longer you&#039;re in this quote-unquote game, the fewer ideas you get. The harder it is to stay &quot;relevant&quot; or interesting. We just say it&#039;s age, but I&#039;m not so quick to agree.

For all that we say about The Beatles, one huge advantage of theirs is that they broke up before the slump set in. Just listen to the songs that came from Lennon &#038; McCartney in the years after The Beatles. People say they suffered from a lack of collaboration, but Lennon and McCartney had pretty much been writing their own stuff post-&quot;Revolver&quot; and much of it still sounded really good.

It&#039;s a matter of diminishing returns, methinks.

And of course there are exceptions; there always are. But Neil Young bores the hell out of me.]]></description>
