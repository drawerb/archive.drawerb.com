					<description><![CDATA[There is another song about Chinese Democracy...by a band that has played at protests in front of Chinese Embassy in Washington DC and at big rallies for Tibet.

It&#039;s ours...we have been in this a long time....not just jumping on that other big band&#039;s latest release after 14 years. We have appeared at pro-China Demcracy rallies all up and down the East Coast including Boston and NYC where thousands were in attendance. We have friends who are in Chinese jails for being Falun Gong......we don&#039;t think that people should &quot;blame it on the Falun Gong&quot; like the other song says.

If you get a moment, check out our song &quot;Chinese Democracy defiled&quot; on our MySpace page. The intro before the singing starts is only 30 seconds...half as short as it is on the other &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; song.

Keep On Rockin in the Free World!
