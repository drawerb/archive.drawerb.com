					<description><![CDATA[The cynic in me wonders if Jeff Buckley&#039;s Grace would be so highly ranked if he were still alive.  

There&#039;s some great stuff in the 700s--Dream Syndicate, Chameleons, Joseph Arthur, Billy Bragg, Shearwater, Grant Lee Buffalo.

Odd to see Yankee Hotel Foxtrot so low.  Maybe people think it hasn&#039;t aged well?  (Summerteeth, Being There and AM are all higher, as Mermaid Avenue.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re spot on about some gross misplacings, but only a few are truly egregious. I do wonder about the generation gap in this poll.

As much as I love to bro down with Band of Horses, I can&#039;t seriously argue that &lt;i&gt;Everything All The Time&lt;/i&gt; is any bit more essential than some of the albums further down the list.

Yep. The skewing is easily be attributed to the Sub Pop connection. 

But, seriously. Temple of the Dog at 550? Come on, Seattleites. &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; is so epic. You know it&#039;s diese.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039; t like Fleet Foxes (husband really digs them), and Eric, I totally agree about Exile in Guyville, which might be the most overrated release of the 1990s.  (I totally predicted Liz Phair&#039;s later selling out.)

As much as I&#039;m an Okkervil River fangirl, why is The Stage Names #226?  Ahead of Parklife?  The Days of Wine and Roses?  And why is Ride&#039;s Nowhere at 623?!?

As infuriating as these lists are, they can be fun to dissect.]]></description>
