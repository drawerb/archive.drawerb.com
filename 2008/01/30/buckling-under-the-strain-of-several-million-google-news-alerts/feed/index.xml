					<description><![CDATA[it bothers me that VW&#039;s buzz will inevitably lead to their demise, seeing as they are genuinely talented, no matter how superficial and gimmicky they are presented. Listen to &quot;I Stand Corrected&quot; or &quot;Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa&quot; and tell me you arent having fun. 

They did a fantastic job producing their new album and i think it pushed their popularity out of the realm of absurdity. 

As my parents have always told me, &quot;I&#039;m not going to ask you to finish everything on your plate, but take a few bites, and if you dont like it, you never have to have it again.&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, they were definitely 2007&#039;s Clap Your Hands Say Yeah.   I was hesitant (read: embarrassed) to list them in my top 10, but I did listen to the shit out of the record last year.  But, much like CYHSY, the novelty wears off after a while.  Then again, isn&#039;t that the point of pop? Like FruitStripes gum, it is.]]></description>
