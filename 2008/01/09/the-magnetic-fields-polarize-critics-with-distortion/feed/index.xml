					<description><![CDATA[k, you are obnoxious. you leave me scratching my head in amazement at your pretentiousness with every post.  distortion is a fine addition to the magnetic fields catalog. this is a rare band that can morph into any number of styles, yet their signature sound is always evident. it&#039;s just another magnetic fields album, a good time if you&#039;re willing to have one. get over yourself, please. 
and while i have your attention, hear me out:
this moronic insistence that making a few dollars by letting your music play on a car commercial amounts to some heinous crime against the underground is so incredibly childish. if the books can afford to record another album instead of getting real jobs, i really don&#039;t care that they are taking money from hummer. in fact, it&#039;s fucking hilarious.]]></description>
