					<description><![CDATA[Eric seems to think this is a bad lineup.  And to some degree, he&#039;s right.  The Headliners aren&#039;t all that impressive.  But like I told him, I&#039;ve never really gone for the Headliners.  I did enjoy Depeche Mode and Daft Punk in &#039;06, but I can&#039;t even remember who headlined in &#039;02 (though I do recall seeing Sigur Ros and Squarepusher.  Both were amazing.  I also remember Blonde Redhead canceled and Aphex Twin as well.  sigh.)

I&#039;m not likely to make it to Coachella this year, but if I were to attend, I would want to see: 

Day 1: Stars, Battles, Mum, Jens Lekman, Architecture in Helsinki, Sharon Jones, Madness, Campire Weekend, The National

Day 2: Portishead, Kraftwerk, Death Cab, Rilo Kiley, M.I.A., Hot Chip, Cold War Kids, Cinematic Orchestra, Teenagers, VHS or Beta, MGMT, Bird and the Bee

Day 3: Love and Rockets, Spiritualized, Justice, Gogol, Chromeo, The Streets, Metric, Dimitri, Sons &amp; Daughters, Black Kids, I&#039;m From Barcelona

I think that is pretty on par with previous coachella&#039;s (excluding the obvious years with mega-stars like Radiohead and The Pixies as headliners).]]></description>
