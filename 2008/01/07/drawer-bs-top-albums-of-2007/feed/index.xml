					<description><![CDATA[Hey Tug, here you go.

To create the 01 and 10 playlist, begin with OK Computerâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s track one, Airbag, and follow this with In Rainbowâ€<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />s track one, 15 Step. Alternate the albums, track by track, until you reach Karma Police on OK Computer, making All I Need the tenth track on the 01 and 10 playlist. Follow Karma Police with Fitter Happier from OK Computer, for tracks eleven and twelve. These two tracks act as a bridge between the first ten and the following ten tracks on the 01 and 10 playlist. Then continue to alternate the albums again, picking up with Faust Arp on In Rainbows, with Electioneering on OK Computer as the following track.

1. Airbag (OK Computer)
2. 15 Step (In Rainbows)
3. Paranoid Android (OK Computer)
4. Bodysnatchers (In Rainbows)

6. Nude (In Rainbows)
7. Exit Music (For A Film) (OK Computer)
8. Weird Fishes/Arpeggi (In Rainbows)

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, that NWW stuff was definitely not on my list of things Logan liked that I should check out.  (no offense, L.)  I have to admit I find it really amusing that NWW and Radiohead are in the same list.  

Speaking of Thom and the gang, I&#039;ve listened to In Rainbows at least a dozen times but I can&#039;t figure out what all the hype is about.  

I even tried the In Rainbows / OK Computer compilation, which made it better, but I still was bored every other song.  And I&#039;d consider myself a fan of Radiohead.  The songs aren&#039;t bad, but they don&#039;t strike me as anything more than a logical extension of OK Computer, about a decade late.

I&#039;m looking forward to checking out Tristan Perich.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Love a few tracks off Perkins&#039;s &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot; - not as an album though. Granted, &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot; is one of the best lyrical jaunts of the year.

The Faust/NWW split isn&#039;t as hardcore unlistenable as some of their previous works, actually. If anything, it was suprisingly accessible - in Faust/NWW terms, of course. 

See for yourselves my dears at www.brainwashed.com (might also wanna check their review of Mr. B&#039;s Anakrid stuff):
