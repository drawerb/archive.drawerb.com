					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, nice that it is finally embeddable.  It really is well done and fits the song quite nicely.

I&#039;ll have to give Sophtware another listen.  My old roommate was a fan of Grandaddy and I tried to get in to them, but it never happened.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I&#039;ve had the page bookmarked for years, but if memory serves, it&#039;s been only recently that Smith has provided an embedding code. 

Plus, I just haven&#039;t had a blog, y&#039;see, to share it with.

I&#039;m rather fond of &lt;i&gt;The Sophtware Slump&lt;/i&gt;. I think it&#039;s Grandaddy&#039;s master stroke (ooh, hush).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The only song by Grandaddy that I like.  I tried them all.  This vids been floating around for years now.  One of the times when a fan created work is accepted and used by the band instead of the creator having his/her pants sued off them by the Label.]]></description>
