					<description><![CDATA[Fascinating blog--is it all about the commodification of punk/prog-rock/emo/indie/goth/etc?  Just a mini-critique: I&#039;m sorry but you&#039;ve humiliated yourself by calling Sonic Youth &quot;The Sonic Youths.&quot;  I will now humiliate myself by saying that I am addicted to Gossip Girl, and that I worship Sonic Youth and have since I first encountered them in middle school, 20-some years ago (not said for cred but to celebrate their staying power).  Re: Gossip Girl, the whole BS narrative of Rufus and Lily, and how often the writers get things *almost right* in their references to 90s indie music is just so wrong.  When Dan said something about &quot;math rock&quot; I almost sh*t myself!  I love it, it&#039;s like watching a train wreck.   I keep wondering if anyone&#039;s writing any critical theory about all this stuff--Hot Topic, Urban Outfitters, and now Burberry et al--let&#039;s sell punk!  If you know of any scholarly works on this stuff, please let me know. xoxo]]></description>
