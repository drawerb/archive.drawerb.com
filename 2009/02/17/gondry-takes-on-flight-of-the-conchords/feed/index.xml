					<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t get this song out of my head.  I&#039;d sing it aloud if I could, but my puritan co-workers wouldn&#039;t like it.

I also loved the second song about ex-girlfriends.

Gondry&#039;s influence was definitely evident in the entire episode, which might be my favorite so far this season, or at least it&#039;s neck-and-neck with the prostitution one.]]></description>
