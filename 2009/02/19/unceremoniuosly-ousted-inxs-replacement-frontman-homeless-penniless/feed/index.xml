					<description><![CDATA[Eric - what&#039;s with the vitriol? INXS - a very talented band that has had their careers shunted by 2 selfish lead singers. This may come as a suprise to you but even with JD, they were still able to pull a crowd of 60,000 at a gig and &#039;switch&#039; was as good as anything they&#039;d produced before. Their show was brilliant and I can&#039;t knock them for their creativity. 
I hope they give JD another go because they still have it - and you might want to deal with the chip on your shoulder, you moron.]]></description>
