					<description><![CDATA[Defintely not the New Order or Joy Division versions of Ceremony - obviously a bit of an instrumental they got some bland band-for-hire to do for the ad.

I don&#039;t blame Barney for redoing &quot;Blue Monday&quot; for a Sunkist advert so New Order could get 300 grand. After reading Hooky&#039;s book about the Hacienda and the amount of money they tipped into that, that&#039;s a group that certainly deserved a few big paydays.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Bernard himself sold out and re-did &quot;Blue Monday&quot; for a Sunkist advert. Then again, the group were being paid 300 grand for it. As long as the money&#039;s OK, I don&#039;t think any of them are complaining.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ceremony is a sacred song, how dare they just trash its legacy to sell bottles of fucking Vodka. All about the love of music? Don&#039;t be so naive, if the company who produced this travesty only wanted to share a love of music, why even mention their product?. If you need advertisements to help you remember a feeling,song or period of time, you really are isolated from the real world, and probably felt little when you hear this song as done by JD, New Order or even the Radiohead version. Anything good that is created as music, art or expression, is eventually ruined, re-manufactured and commercialised by corporations with the time and money. As another poster said, so very sad.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[what a God send! I&#039;m ever so grateful for Joy Division/ New Order to be brought back into my heart &#038; soul. Though Ian Curtis may not have wanted his music commercialized, because it was all about the love of his music, this IS all about the love of his music. Without it I wouldn&#039;t have recently seen their documentary or movie &quot;Cobtrol&quot;, these, as was Joy Division&#039;s music ate true gifts.]]></description>
