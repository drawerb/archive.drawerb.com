					<description><![CDATA[i agree that he&#039;s not nearly at britney or whitney levels. perhaps, by comparison, my descriptors do sound extreme, but he just came off extremely weird in that piece. he functions, when he&#039;s not slumped over in his car. i mean, how does that happen to a non-crazy person that many times?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see why you say George &quot;doesn&#039;t have a handle on how to function&quot; or is a &quot;loon.&quot; He&#039;s clearly functional, as he just completed a sellout world tour spanning 40+ countries. 

Compare that to someone like Whitney, or even your average rapper... and see that George is doing just fine.

Nor is he a loon, as he continues to take on political causes and write hits that keep him wealthy. Being aware of his lifestyle and choosing to keep it does not make him crazy; the two are not mutually exclusive.

While you may not agree with the way he lives his life, the two descriptors you picked are pretty clearly off the mark.]]></description>
