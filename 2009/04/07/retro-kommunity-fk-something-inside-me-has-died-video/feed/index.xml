					<description><![CDATA[Thanx for your kudos, words. But as far as your saying that my &#039;look&#039; was &quot;cheesy&quot; is quite off the mark. At that time NOBODY looked like me. Nor did anybody even sound close to Kommunity FK, my passion, my concept. Alot of now famous/infamous personages had come to many of our performances taking notes whose names I refuse to mention here. 
But, again, thanx for taking notice on what indeed is a composition that came from my experiences &#038; my Heart. 
Btw, that video had legs then &#038; is still being played in today&#039;s &#039;Goth/Deathrock&#039; klubs all over the world, so I&#039;ve been told.
Kommunity FK is heading out on tour beginning in late August into September. A brand new lp is being recorded as well. It&#039;s not that I&#039;m flogging a deathrock horse, I luv all animals, but, I can only still not stop Kommunity FK with it&#039;s most loving fans &#038; as  self expressuion through my Vision&#038;Voice moniker.]]></description>
