					<description><![CDATA[yeah, i&#039;ve been following a few items on ebay, and there doesn&#039;t seem to be too much action. i think some of these sellers definitely overestimated the demand, especially at some of those prices. that tom waits 7&quot; seems to be going for consistently high prices, though.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It doesn&#039;t look like the sellers are finding too much action on ebay so hopefully they&#039;ll be forced to start selling this stuff at a loss and leave the stores alone next year.  I do think it was a pretty impressive array of items put together for this event.   There were more than a few things I would have liked to have gotten my hands on.   I guess the best thing to hope for at this point is that everything was snatched up by speculators who have overestimated the real interest in this stuff.  Very few things with opening bids above retail price seem to be seeing any bidding.]]></description>
