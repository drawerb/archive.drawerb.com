					<description><![CDATA[Unwound, one of my all time favorites. I saw every show I could get to and no matter how many or how few people showed up, it was always a good show. I saw them at the Jabberjaw at least once and got hit in the head by a chunk of plaster that fell from the ceiling, that shithole had some great shows. 
I&#039;ve got some vivid images in my mind of another Unwound show at a VFW, or maybe it was a Lions Club in Pomona or something, no stage, no fancy PA, no special lighting, couldn&#039;t have been more than 20 people there. Some of the old Lions Club dudes were hanging around checking out the show, seeming kinda confused by the scene around them. At the end of the show they let the feedback rattle the windows for a while before ripping off their guitar &#038; bass strings. 
I loved Unwound. Fawk, am I old? Naaaah.]]></description>
