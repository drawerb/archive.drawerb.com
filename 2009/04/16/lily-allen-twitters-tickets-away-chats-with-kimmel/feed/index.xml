					<description><![CDATA[Kimmel really didn&#039;t do his research,  because Lily Allen had, at this point already filed and was given, a restraining order against the paparazzi. The last was one of three incidents with the paps. 1. hit by a paparazzi in her car. 2. Almost run over by a paparazzi, while walking in London. 3. Almost collided with a bus, trying to avoid a paparazzi, while on the way to her Nan&#039;s funeral. Of course Lily Allen doesn&#039;t enjoying being in the tabloids, but she can not very well tell people that it&#039;s a problem, just something she has to except. Again she is filing a lawsuit against a tabloid magazine, for misquoted drug remarks. Her image in the tabloids have become less aggressive, at this point, so Kimmel should have avoided the subject all together.]]></description>
