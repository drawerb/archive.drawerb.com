					<description><![CDATA[They never lasted more than a day.  When they would arrive the happy hour crowd might pass them around then they would usually disappear before nightfall.  I remember in one of the first issues we got there was a results of an online readers poll for who they wanted in a pictorial most and the landslide winner was Neko Case.   I found it very bizarre that Playboy readers knew who she was much less wanted to see her naked.]]></description>

Of course we accepted and I&#039;m pretty sure they still get them.  Between all the Niko Case articles, marketing to indie rock clubs, and Dinosaur Jr vids, Playboy must consider aging indie rockers a pretty sizable part of their niche.]]></description>
