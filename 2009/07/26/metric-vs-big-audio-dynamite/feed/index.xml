					<description><![CDATA[Interesting.  I&#039;m usually the one pointing out these sorts of things.  I can kinda hear what you&#039;re talking about.  I&#039;ve always thought that something about that song was reminiscent of something else as it is definitely an amalgamation of sounds.

BAD was just great fun and shouldn&#039;t be compared to the Clash, which no-one will ever live up to.]]></description>
