					<description><![CDATA[Hey there, I was looking for some Blur posts on Elbow.ws, and your blog came up. It&#039;s really good to see someone else blogging about this, as when I heard the news on Monday I thought it was a bit strange as well. I&#039;m more of a Blur fan than a New Order fan, but I&#039;m interested in seeing what happens with this.

Anyway, great blog, just wanted to say that I stopped by and liked what I saw. :)]]></description>
