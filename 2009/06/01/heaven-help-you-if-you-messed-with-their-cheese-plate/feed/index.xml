					<description><![CDATA[These are great memories people.  I&#039;m a huge Blur fan, wrote a book on them.  If you&#039;re interested in Blur check out my website.

I&#039;m looking for copies of tapes of three Atlanta Blur shows (&#039;94 at Masquerade, &#039;96 at Cotton Club, &#039;03 at Tabernacle), if anyone has them, please contact me :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, now that I think about it, I was at that Tabernacle show.  Moving Units opened up for them.  Twas strange without Graham.

The strangest blur show I think I&#039;ve ever seen was when Smash Mouth opened for them in Santa Barbara.  Yeah, Smash Mouth.  WTF?!  The crowd was full of frat boys.  Totally bizarre.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was in London in 1994, they were playing Shepherd&#039;s Bush Empire, right about the time of the release of Parklife.  Sadly, that show was sold out.  I was starting to think I&#039;d never seem them live!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;./../index.html#comment-1677&quot;&gt;AJW&lt;/a&gt;.

I was at the Cotton Club show, as well.  Don&#039;t know if there were tix for that show.  But the first time I saw them was at Masquerade.  I think I saw blur 3 times in Atlanta, but I may be mistaken.  I&#039;ve seen them on both US coasts but sadly never in the UK.]]></description>
