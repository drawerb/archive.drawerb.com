					<description><![CDATA[Hi Eric,

Nice post on the musical.  My associate is working on this project, but I keep track of it as well.

I wanted to get in touch about the artist Matthew Barber who just release his US debut for drawer b consideration. He begins a US tour next week and I&#039;d love to send a link to download the record and additional details.
