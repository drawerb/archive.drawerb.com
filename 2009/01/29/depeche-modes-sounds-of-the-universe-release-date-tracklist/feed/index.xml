					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been a die hard Depeche Mode fan for years and I have to say that I was very disappointed with this album.  

Most of the songs had a very &quot;new age&quot; sound to them - there was very little of the trade mark Depeche Mode sound which is what I feel (just a personal opinion) set them aside from the rest.  The one song that I do enjoy from a music point of view is Peace - pity about the lyrics though.

To be juvenile about it - Yuck!  I have to agree with Dave - they&#039;re going to have to step it up a notch and go back to basics with any future ablums they release otherwise it&#039;ll be RIP.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[dude, i cant blame you.

I think the last really good DM album was Ultra because they collaborated w/other outside artists in the studio, like Jaki from Can. This really helped fill the void of not having Alan Wilder and Flood.

I must say, I listened to the Depeche Mode album &#039;SOTU&#039;, and it sounded really terrible. That&#039;s hard for me to say.

It was even  worse than Exciter, if you can believe that. The album is filled with a bunch of synth blip sounds throughout, almost like they were trying to copy Trent Reznor(Ghosts/Year Zero).

What is actually suprising is that Dave&#039;s songs are better than Martin&#039;s songs.  All and all, the album seems to be underproduced in a bad way.

I think this is probably going to be the end for DM, that&#039;s really hard for me to say, I own all the albums and have been a huge fan. 

Don&#039;t buy the Deluxe Edition crap, it wont be money well spent. But I would like to hear the old demo&#039;s featured on there.

I guess we can only hope that there will be some nice songs coming out after this album since they have a lot of songs left over.]]></description>
