					<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t recall the harley davidson cafe at all, but that is hilarious and sounds about right. 

i would never have remembered the name of the venue where we saw pj harvey, but, yeah, it ranks way up there for me too. i remember we all shat our pants when we saw her walking down the street and proceeded to follow her stalker-style to that record store. good times.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I had totally forgotten that was the same night.  We also ate at the Harley Davidson cafe  - not sure that ranks up there with the other two.  

I&#039;d have to say seeing PJ Harvey at Tipitina&#039;s is up there as with Buckley as two of the best shows I&#039;ve ever seen.  Do you remember seeing her at the record store that afternoon?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Eric -   I&#039;ve long considered getting to see Buckley at CMJ a highlight of a lifetime of seeing live music.  Of course at the time, I hadn&#039;t heard the album and assumed the son of a famous dead musician signed to a major label for his debut album was sure to be an evening of ear fucking and was probably looking more forward to seeing Geraldine Fibbers.  Watching you pretend to be a smoker to hang out with Love &#038; Rockets was a nice touch also.  

I would stab a pencil in my ear before listening to this song by the way.]]></description>
