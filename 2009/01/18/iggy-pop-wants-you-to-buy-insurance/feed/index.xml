					<description><![CDATA[I guess.  I didn&#039;t really catch the name of the company, I just felt sad/embarrassed for iggy pop.  Then again, he sold himself out years ago when he whore&#039;d out Lust for Life to Carnival cruise lines, so why not car insurance, I suppose.  To his credit he&#039;s fit for a geezer and has been for decades.  Cryogenics?]]></description>
