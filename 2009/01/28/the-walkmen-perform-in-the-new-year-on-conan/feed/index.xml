					<description><![CDATA[man, late night has been incredible this week: these guys, andrew bird, M83. leithauser&#039;s voice reminds me of yours sometimes; i can see why you&#039;re a fan. the greatest thing is his ability to stay on pitch, even when he&#039;s clearly not in his most comfortable range. i was not all that into their previous efforts, but they really won me over with this record. great post!]]></description>
