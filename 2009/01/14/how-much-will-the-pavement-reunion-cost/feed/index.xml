					<description><![CDATA[I started listening to Pavement in 2006. I listen to almost every genre and own over 1000 albums, and still Pavement are my all time favourite.

I will not go and see them on their upcoming tour.

Their songs and videos occasionally make me feel wonderful and even sometimes manage to turn all the crap life throws at me into a menial matter. 

I don&#039;t wanna spoil that by going to see what&#039;s now basically a Pavement tribute band.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My bet is that they are looking for some very large numbers to play mainstage (probably not as the headliner) at some European events and a couple of large US outdoor events.  The money to pay bands at these things is retarded.  They were with the same agent most of their career so imagine he&#039;s been fielding calls ever since and knows what the market is like.  Their show on the final tour was in Atlanta at the Cotton Club w/ U.S. Maple and frankly I can&#039;t imagine them being able to sustain a long US tour in rooms much larger than that.  They would be able to get away with a substantial ticket price increase.  I could easily see putting them in the music farm on a $30+ ticket and having no problem selling it out - I wouldn&#039;t want to try and make the jump to a 2000+ seat room.

By the way, I always thought I was alone in thinking Brighten the Corners was their best work.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From my informal polls, they seem to have attracted a lot more fans post-breakup, which might help to pad their numbers at the outdoor festivals of &#039;09.  Though, the variety (unevenness?) in their catalog and fan base might pose significant problems for their set list creation.

I still listen to Brighten The Corners and Slanted &amp; Enchanted.  Both are totally brilliant in completely different ways.]]></description>
