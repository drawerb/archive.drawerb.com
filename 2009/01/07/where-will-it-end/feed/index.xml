					<description><![CDATA[Weird. I really liked KoD back in college but never considered (or noticed) their influence on Interpol, but listening now I can kinda see your point.  I can totally hear Interpol doing Mad as Snow.

I have no qualms with bands wearing their influences on their sleeves, so long as it isn&#039;t their only trick.

I don&#039;t hear Joy Division in TVOTR at all.  Are we talking Dear Science or Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes?  Maybe I need to re-listen to those.  I&#039;d say She Wants Revenge is the most guilty rip off of the Joy Division sound.  By Far.]]></description>
