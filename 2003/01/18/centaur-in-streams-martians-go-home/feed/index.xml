					<description><![CDATA[only a fool would compare Matt Talbot to Mike Stipe of REM. There isn&#039;t anything there that even remotely compares to each other. CENTAUR&#039;s album is a piece of beautiful work; over-looked, and underrated--almost all about Lost love, and quite possibly the loss of a child. This site is as old as yesteryear&#039;s crumbs, so...yea. HUM rules. Bands of today suck. Good luck]]></description>
